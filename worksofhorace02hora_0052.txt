zm THE WORKS OF HORACF,

SATIRE IX.

ΜΗΘ· IN G, as wont‚ on this and that,
Such trifles, as 1 know not what,
When late the street Ι saunter'd through,
:A wight, whose name I hardly knew,
Approaching pertly makes me stand,
And thus accosts me, hand in hand :
‘⁶ How do you do, my sweetest man ?'’
Quoth I, As well as mortal can,
And my best wishes yours--when he
&Vould follow—What’s yourwill with me i·
‘³ That one of your profound discerning

ζ Should know me : I'm a man of learningst’*

Why, then, be sure upon that score

You merit my regard the more.

Impatient to diseard the sop,

One whiieI run, another stop,

And whisper, as he presses near,

Some nothing in my servant’s ear.
Butwhile at every pore I sweated,

. And thus in muttering silence 'fretum--

‘⁶ Bolanus, happy in a skull

Of proof, impenetrably dull,

Ο for a portion of thy brains”-

He on the town and streets and lanes

His prating, prajsing taient tried,

· And, whenl answer'd not, he cried,

‘⁴ Ay, ’tis too plain ς you can’t deceive me.
You miserably wish to leave me,
