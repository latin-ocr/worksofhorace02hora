EPISTLES, BOOK 1. ² 16⁷

uis numbers, to the Roman lyre unknown,
&nd joy, that works of such unheard-os taste
By men os worth and genius were embrac'd.
But would you know, why some condemn abr-oad-
Thankless, unjust‚ what they at home applaud ?
1 purchase not the venal critic's vote
With costly -suppers, or a thread-bare coat ς
'rhe works of titled wits 1 never hear,
Nor vengeful in my turn assault their ear.
The tribe of grammar-pedants ἑ despise,
And hence these tears of spleen and anger rise.
1 blush in grand assemblies to repeat
My worthless works, and give such trisses weight :
Yet these professious they with wonder hear—-
⁴⁶ No. You reserv'd them for dread Caesar's ear-3
With your own beauties charm'd, you surely know
' Your verses with a honey'd sweetness flow.'’
δῖοι· dare I rally with such dangerous solk,
LestI be torn to pieces for a joke‚
Yet beg they would appoint another day,
A place more proper to decide the sray ς
Forjestsa fearsal strife and anger breed,
whence quarrelsfierce and Juneral wars pro'ceed.
