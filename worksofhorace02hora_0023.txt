SATIRES, BOOK Ι. 15

'Phrough the thin robe stands naked to your eye:
Or, is you will be cheated‚ pay the fair,
With‘'foolish fondness, ere she shows her ware.
As when a s1.ortsman through the snowy waste
Pursues a hare, which he disdains to tame,
‘⁴ So (sings the take) my passion can despise
An easy prey, but follow when it flies.”
Yet can these idle vers-icles remove
.. The griess and torturas of thls guilty love ἓ
were it not better wisdom to inquire
How nature bounds each impetent (ἰθείης
What she with ease resigns⁹ or wants with pain,
And thus divide the solid from the vain ?
Say. should your jaws with thirst severely burn,
Would you a cleauly earthen pitcher spurn ?
Should hunger on your gnawing entrails seim,
Will turbot only or a peacoek please?
Lot her be stra1ght and fairq nor wish to have

” Or height or colour Nature never gave :

Then, while with joy 1 woo the pleasing fair,
What nymph, what goddeSS, can with mine compare? “
No terrors rise to mterrupt my joys‚ ’

No jealous husband, nor the searful noise

Of bursting doors, nor the loud hideousyelling

Of barking (lo-gs, that snakes the matron’s dweIHng,
When the pale wauton leaps from off her bed,

The conscious chambot-maid screams out her dread
of horrid torture33 loudly ories the wife,

“ My jointure‘s lost,”-l tremble for my life:
Unbutton'd, without shoes, I speed away,

Lest in my person, putee, or same, 1 pay.

To be surpris'd is, sure, a wretched tale,

And sor the truth to Fabius 1 appeal.
