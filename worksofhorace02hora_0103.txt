SATIRES, BOOK 11.

'Where shall 1 find another man so just,
Firrn in his love, and faithful to his trust?
Squeeze out some tears: 'tis fit in such a case
Το cloak your joys beneath a mournful thee,
Though left to your discretionary care,
Erect a tomb magnincently fair,
And let your neighbours‚ to proclaim abroad
Your fame, the pompous funera] applaud-

If any vassal ofthe will-compeers‚
With asthma gasping, and advanc'd in years,
Should be dispos'd to purchase house or land,
Tell him that he may readily command
Whatever may to your proportion come,
And for the value, let him name the sum—-
But 1 am summon’d by the queen of hell
Back to the shades. Live artful, and farewelz.

SATlRE VI.

1 OFTEN wish'd Ι had a sarm,

A decent dwelling snug and warm,
Α gamen, and a spring as pure

As crystal running by my door,

“ Resides a little ancient grove,

Where at my leisure 1 might rove.
The gracious gods, to crown my bliss,
Have granted this, and more than this3
1 have enough in my possessing ς
‘Tis well: 1 ask no greater messing,
0 Hennes! than remote from strife
