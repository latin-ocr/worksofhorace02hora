174 sm: WORKS OF HORACE‘

'rin low in equal death her conqueror lies ς

For he, who soars to an unwonted height,
Oppressive dazzles, with excess of light,

The arts beneath him ς yet, when dead, shall prove
An object worthy of esteem and love.

Yet Rome to thee her living honours pays ε

By thee we swear, to thee our altars raise,

While we confess no prince so great, so wisc,

Hath ever risen, or shall ever rise.

But when your people raise their Caesar's name
Above the Greek and Roman chiefs in fame,
In this one instance they are just and wise,

Yet other things they view with other eyes ς
With cold contempt they treat the living hard 3
The dead alone can merit their regard.
To elder bards so lavish of applause,
They love the language of our ancient laws ς
On Numa’s hymns with holy rapture pore,
And turn our mouldy records o’er and o'er ;
‘I'hen swear, transported, that the Sacred Nine
Pronounc’d on Alba's top each hallow’d line.
But if, because the world with justice pays
To the first bards of Greece its grateful praise,
ln the same scale our poets must be weigh’d,
To such disputes what answer can be made ?
Since we have gain'd the height of martial fame,
Let us in peaceful arts assert our claim ς
The ancinted Greeks no longer shall excel,
And neither wrestle, sing, or paint so well.
But let me ask, Since poetry‚ like wine,
Is taught by time to mellow and refine,
When shall th’ immortal bard begin to live ἱ·
Say, shall a hundred years completely give
