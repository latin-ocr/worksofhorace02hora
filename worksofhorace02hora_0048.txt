40 THE woRKs OF HORACE.

Persius begins; loud bursts of laughter rise3

He praises Brutus, Brutus, to the skies‚

‘⁴ Brutus, like Sol, o'er Asia pours the day ;

His friends are stars‚ and healthful is their ray.

Except the King3 he like the dog-star reigns,

That dog of heaven, detested by the swajns3”

Thus rushed he onward like a winter-flood,

That tears its banks, and sweeps away the wood-
To this impetuous bitterness of tide

The King with equal virulence replied.

-A vine-dresser he was, of rustic tone,

VVhom oft the traveller was forc’d to own

Invineible3 with clamamus voice opprest,

When Cuckow‚ cuck0w‚ was the standing jesi.
But, with Italian vinegar imbued‚

The seur-tongued mongrel the dispute renew'd 3

“ Let me conjure thee, by the powers divine,

Since 'tis ‘the glot-y, Brutus, of thy line

To slaughter Kings‚ be this thy glorious deed,

That. this same King beneath thy vengeance bleed.'’
