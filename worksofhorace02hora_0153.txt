WfflLE Iccius farms Agrippa's large estate²
{f he with wisdom can enjoy his sate,
No greater riches Jove himself can give ς
Then cease complaining, friend, and leam to live.
He is not poor to whom kind Fortune grente,
Even with a srugal hand, what Nature wants.
Are you with fond, and warmth, and raiment bles? ⁶
Not royal treasuoes are os more possest 3
, And if, for herbs and shell-fish at a feast,
You leave the various luxuries of taste,
Should Fate enrich you with a golden stream,
Your life and manners would be still the same;
whether convinc’d, that gold can't change the soui.
Or that sair virtue should its power control.
That all his neighbour‘s flocks and herds should ea?
The sage's harvest, while without its weight
His spirit rov'd abroad, shall ne’er be told
As wonderful ; since, not debas’d by gold,
And its insecti0n‚ Iccius, bravely wise,
Spums this vlle earth, and soars into the skies;
Curious to search, what bounds old ocean's tides .;
what through the various year the seasons guides z
VVbether the stars by their own proper force,
Or foreign power, pursue their wandering course ·
