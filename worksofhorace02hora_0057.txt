SA TIRES, BOOK 11.

At last, by special act of grace,
The plaintiff meets him face to sace,
And bawls as loud as he could bellow ι
“ Ha ! whither now, thou vilest sellow ἓ
Sir, will you witness to my capture ?”
1 signified, l would with rapture 3
And then, to magnify the sport,
He drags my prattler into court ;
And thus, amidst the noise and rabble.

Apollo sav’d me in the squabble.

SATIRE X.

YES, 1 did say, Lucil-ius' „verses roll‘d
ln ruder style precipitately boldt,

Who reads Lucilius with so fond an eye,
Partially fond, who can this charge denyf
But, that with wit he lash'd a vicious age,
He's frankly prais'd in the same equa] page.
Should 1 grant more, I may as well ‘admit
Laberius* sarces elegantly writ.

'Tis not enough a bursting laugh to raise,
Yet ev'n this talent may desetve its praise z
Concise your diction ; let your sense be clear„
Nor with a weight of words fatigue the ear.
Now change from grave to gay with ready art,
Now play the orator’s or poet's part ;

In raillery assume a gayer air,

Discreetly hide your strength, your vigour spare.
