74 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

{f in his cellar lie a thousand ssasks
(Nay, let them rise to thrice a thousand casksj-
of old F alernian, or the Chian vine,
Yet if he drink mere vinegar sor wine ς
If. at fourscore, ofstraw he made his bed,
While moths upon his rotting carpets fed 3
By few, forsooth, a madman he is thought,
For half mankind the same disease have dauglr,
Thou dotard, cursed in thelove of pelf,
For sear of starving, will you starve yoursels ‚²⁴
Or do you this ill-gotten treasure save
For a luxurious son, or savourite slave ?
How little would thy mass of money waste.
Did you on better oil and cabbage feast,
Or on thy clotted haitssand dandruff-head‚
A sweeter, more expensive esseuce shed Ξ
If nature wish §br no immoderate store,
‘When you forswear, and rob, and steal for more,
Stin are you sound ? But, when your folly raves,
If you should stone the people, or your slaves ;
Those slaves, whom you with pelf, how precious?

Our boys and girls, A madman, madman ! cry.
Is your head safe, although you hang your wife,
Or take by poison your old mother's life?
What ἔ nor in Argos you commit the deed,
ὟΝοῐ did your mother by a dagger bleed ς
Νοι· by a mad Orestes was she §lain-—
But was Orestes of untainted brain.
Or was he not by furies dire possest,
Before he plung'd his dagger in her breast?
Yet from the timeyou holdhim hurt in mind,
His actions are of harmleSS, blameless kind.
