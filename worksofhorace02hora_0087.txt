SATn'zES, BOOK 11.

³ Agamemnon.

- But 1, while adverse winds tempestuous roar,
fro loose our fated navy from the shore
Wisely with blood the powers fflvine atone—-

Stertinius.
What ! your own b}ood‚ you madman ?
Agamemnon.

Yes, my own:
But yet not mad.

Stertinius.
'Tis a disorder'd head,
Which, by the passiens in confusion led,
The images of right and wrong mistakes‚
And tage or solly no great difference makes.
Was Ajax mad, when those poor lambs he slew?
⁵ And are your senses right, while you pursue,
«ὲ. With such a crime, an empty title's fame?
Is the heart pure high-swelling for a name ?
Should a man take a lambkin in his chan,
With fondling names caress the spotless sair 3
Clodios, maids, and gold, as for his child, provide,
And a stout husband for the lovely bride,
His civil rights the judge would take away,
And to trustees in guardianship convey. ·
Then sure you will not call him sound of hrain,
ssy whom his daughter sora lamb was slain.
Folly and guilt are madness in th‘ extreme ;
The impious and the mad etei-nally the same.
,· Blood-stained Bellona thunders round his head.
⁸* Who is by glassy same a captive led.
Now try the sons of luxui y, you'll find,
Right reason proves them fools of madding kind
