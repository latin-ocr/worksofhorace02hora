Stertinius.

Greatest of monarchs, may the powers divine
A sase return permit you to enj0y,

With your victorious ficet, from ruin’d Troy-⁵·-
But may I ask, and answer without sear ?

Agamemnon..
You may.
Stertinius.
Then wherefore rots great Ajax here,
For many a Grecian sav’d who well might claim
To brave Achilles the next place in fame ?
Is it that Priam, and the sires of Troy,
May view his carcass with malignam joy,
By whom their Ι-οῐιε so oft destroy'd in fight
111 their own country want the funeral rite ?

Agamemnon.
A thousand sheep the frantie kin’ d, and cried.
‘Here both Atrides; there Ul) ss es died.”

Stertinius.

When you1 own child you to the altar led,
And pour'd the salted meal upon her head ,ἡ
'When you beheld the lovely victim slain, · Ἰ
Unnatural father 2 were you sound of hrain?

Agamemnon.
Why not ?
Stertinius.

'rhen what did frantie Ajax cio„
When in his tage a thousand sheep he slew ἓ
Nor on his wife or son he drew his sword,
On Atreus' sons alone his curses pour'd ς
Nor on his brother turn’d the vengeful steel„
Nor did ulysses his resentment feel.
