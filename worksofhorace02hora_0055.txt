SATIRES, BOOK Ι .

’ ··· Commend me to your brother-hard,

No man has play’d a surer card.

But you should have a man of art ς

One who might act an under-part.

If you were pleas'd to recommend

The man 1 mention, to your friend,

Sir, may I never see the light

But you shall rout your rivals quite !’'--·
We hve not there, as you suppose,

On such precarious terms as those :

No family was ever purer3

From such infections none securer.

lt never hurts me in the least,

That one excels in weahh, or teste ;

A thing almost beyond belief.”-—

‘⁶ This adds but fuel to the fire,

The more you kindle my desire

To kiss his hand, and pay my courtss'»

Assail, and you shall take the fort.
Such is the vigour of your wit,

And heis one that can submit ς

The first attack is therefore nice,

The matter is to break the ice.

‘⁴ Ι shan't be wanting there‚” he cried,
⁴⁶ l'll bribe his servants to my side 3
To-day shut out, still onward press,
And watch the seasons of access ς

ln private haunt, in public meet,
