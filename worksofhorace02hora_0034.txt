ἢ 26 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

This man is vile: here, Roman, fix your mark ·,
His soul is black, as his bounplexion’s dark.
At tables, crowded with a dozen guests‚
Some one shall scatter round his frigid· jests,
And only spare his host, until the bowl,
F air friend of truth, unlocks his inmost soulz

content with what his industry could give,
In frugal, sparing sort, ‘⁶ Behold, my son,
Young Albius there, how wretchedly undone Ξ
Yet no mean lesson is the spendthrist's sate
