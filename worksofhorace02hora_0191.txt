EPISTLES, BOOK 11. 180·

Complaining that our toils, how wondfous great!

Are unobserv’d—that subtilty os thought,

That fine-spun thread, with which our poem⁴>
wrought:

Or when we hope, that, soon as Caesar knows

That we can rhimes abundantly compose,

Our fortune's made 3 he shall to court invito

Our bashsul Muse‚ compelling us to write.

Yet it is thine. Ο Caesar, to inquire
How far thy virtue can her priests inspire,

In peace or war, to sing her hero's same,
Nor trust to worthless barcis the sacred theme.

Dan Choerilus was poet-laureat made
By Philip's conqueringson, who bounteous paid
The gold, ou which his father’s image shines‚
For misbegotten and unshapen lines ;

And yet as ink the spotless hand defiles,
So our same sair a wretched scribbler soils.

Yet the same monach, who thus dearly paid
For worthless rhimes, a solemn edict made,
That none but sam’d Apelles dare to trace‚

In desperate colours, his imperial sace ;

And that Lysippus should presume alone

To mould great Ammon's souin brass or stone.
Then take this critic in the arts that lie
Beneath the power and judgment of the eye,
Take him to books, and poetry‚ you'll swear,
This king was born in thick Boeotian air.

But, never, sir, shall your judicious tastc

By Virgil or by Varius be disgrac’d‚

For to your bounty they shall grateful raise

A deathless monument of same and praise3

Nor sorm’d in braosa with more expression shines
