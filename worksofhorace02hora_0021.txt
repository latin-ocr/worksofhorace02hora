SATIRES, BOOK Ι. 13

And trade with females of the second rate.

·‘ Yet Sallust rages here with wild desines,

As mad as those which lawless love inspires.”

But had he been wzth less profusion kind,

Had common sense his lavish hand confin'd,

. He had not now been wholly lost to shame,

In fortune ruin’d, as undone in fame.

But here’s the joy and comfort os his life,

To swear, he never touch'd his neighbour’s wife.
Thus. to an actress when with lav=sh hand

Marsaeus gave his mansion-house and land,

My soul, thank heaven. hc eries, from guilt is ἔτεος

ν The wedded dames are vestal maids sor me.

Aetress or not. the eritne is still the same,
Equal the ru'm ofestate and fa1ne3
Equal the folly. whether in pursuit
Os wife, οι· slave, or loose-rob'd prostitute;
ἵ Unless you mean, content to be unclone,
To hate the person, not the vice to shun.
Of Sylla's wanton daughter when possest,
Villius believ'd himself supremely blest:
⁷ To a dictator thus to be allied,
Dazzled his senses, and indulg'd his pride!
But sure, if vanity were fairly rated‚
ι Methinks poor Villius was rull hardly treatecil,
When buffeted and stabb’d the coxcomb dies,
While in the wanton‘s arms a scoundrel lies.
But Nature, rich in her own proper wealth
Os youth and beauty‚ cheerfulness and health,
In her pursuit of happiness disclaims
The pride ostitles‚ and the pomp ofnames,
Be thine her wise economy to leam,
And real stom affected bliqgretliseern.
