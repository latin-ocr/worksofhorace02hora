33?- THE WORKS OF HORACE..

Admire the rich buffet, the marble bust,

The bronze antique, the purple's glowing dye,
The gem, whose radiance trembles on the eye;
Let gazing crowds your eloquence admito,

At early mom torcour‘t, at night rente,

Lest Mutus wed a wife os large estate,

While, deeper your dishonour to complete,
The low-born wretch to you no honour pays,
Though you on him with admiration gaze.

But time shall bring the latent birth to lightf
And hide the present glorious rane in night ς
For though Agrippa's awful collonade‚

Or Appian way, thy passing pomp smvey‘d,
It yet remains to tread the drear descent,
there good Pompilius and great Ancus went}

Would you not wish to cure th' acuter pains,
That rack your tortur'd side, or vex your teins ?
VVould you, and who would not, with pleasure live·
J f virtue can alone the blessing give,

With ardent spirit her alone pursue,

And with contempt all other pleasures view.
Yet, if you think that virtue’s but a name3
That groves are grows, nor from religion claim.
A sacred awe'3 sail to the distant coast.

Nor let the rich Bithynian trade be lost.

A thousand talents be therounded sum

You first design’d ς then raise a second plumg
A third successive be your earnest care,

And add a forth to make the mass a square 3

1·ΙἹ or gold, the sovereign queen of all below,
Friends, honour, birth, and beauty can bestow ;-
The goddess os persuasion forms his train,

A nd Venus denks the well-bemoney’d swain.-
