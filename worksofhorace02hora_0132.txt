124 THE WORKS OF HORACE Ψ· ἲ

-But though in health you doze away your days,
You run, when puff'd with dropsical disease.
U nless you light your 'early lamp, to find
A moral book; unless you form your mind
To nobler studies, you shall forfeit rest,
And love or envy shall distract your breast.
For the hurt eye an instant cure you find;
Then why neglect, sor years, the sickening mind ἓ ρ,
Dare to be wise3 begin3 for, once magun,
Your task is easy3 half the work is done:
And sure the man, who has itin his power
To practise virtue, and protracts 1he hour,
Waits‚ like the rustic, till the river dried:
Stin glides the river, and will ever glide.
For wealth‚ and wives of fruitfulness we t0313
We stub the forest, and reclaim the soil.
Bless’d witn a competence‚ why wish for more?
Nor house, nor lands‚ nor heaps os labour'd ore
Can give their severish lord one moment's rest,
Or drive one sorrow from his anxious breast3
The fond possessor must be hiessjd with health,'
W ho rightly means to use his boarded wealth.
Houses and riches gratisy the breast
For lucre lu'sting‚ or with fear deprest,
As piantes, glowing with a vivid light, a
With painsul pleasure charm a blemish'd sight3
As chasurg sooths the gout, or music cheers
Τ he tingling organs of imposthum’d ears.
Your wine grows aeid when the cask is foul:
Learn the strong sense os pleasure to control ;
With virtuous pride its blandishments disdain;
Hurtful is pleasure, when it's bought with pain.
