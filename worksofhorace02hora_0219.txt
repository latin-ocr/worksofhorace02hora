well done 2 my boy, the joyful father eries,
‚addition and subn-action make us wise.

But when the rust of wealth pollutes the soul,
And money’d cares the genius thus controul‚
How shall we dare to hope, that distant times
XVith honour should preserve our lifeless rhimes?

Poets would profit or delight mankind,

And with the pleasing have th’ instructive join’d
Short be the precept, which with ease is gain’d
ssy docile minds, and faithtully retain⁷d.

If in dull length your moral is exprest‚

'Phe tedious wisdom overflows the breast„
Would you divert? the probable maintaim

Nor force us to believe the monstrous scene,
shat shows a child, by a feu witch devouffd,
Dragg'd from her emaus, and to life restor’d.

Grave age approves the solid and the wise÷
Gay youth from too austere a drama flies :
Profit and measure, then, to mix with art,
4ηΓο inform the judgment, nor offend the hearl,
§hall gain al! votem to booksellers shall raist
No trivial fortune, aud across the seas
To distant nations spread the writer’s fame,
And with immortal honours cmwn his name„

Yet there are saults that we may well excuse,
Fur ost the strings th' intended sound refuso ς
Iu vaIn his tuneful hand the master tries,

He asks a ssat, and hears a sharp arise3
'Nor alwayssswill the bow, though sam'd sor art,
With speed unerring wing the 'threatening dart.

But where the beauties more in number shinc,

1 am not angry when a casual line
' (Tnat with some trivial faults unequal news>
A careless hand, or human frailty, shows.
