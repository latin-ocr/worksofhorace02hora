THE ART OF POETRY. 205

Τ he tragic hard, who, sor a wonhless prize,
ΒΜ nakcd satyrs in his cllrous rise,

Though rude his min-th, yet labour'd to maintaiu
'she solemn grandem os the tragic scene3

For novelty alone, he knew, could cham)

A lawless crowd, with wine and feasting warm.

And yet this langhing, prating tribe may raisc
Our mirtln, nor shall their pleasantry displease ι
But let the hero, or the power divine,

Whom late we saw with gold and purple shint-
Stoop not in vulgar phrase, nor yet despise
The words os earth, and soar into tho skie5.
For as a matron‚ on our festal <lays

Oblig’d ιο clance, with modest grace obeys‚

So should the Mose her dignity maintaln
Amidst the satyrs and their wauton train.

If e’er I write, no words too grossly vile
shall shame 1ny satyrs, and pollute my style.
'Nor would I yet the tragic style sorsake
So sar, as not some difference to make
Between a slave, or wench, too penly bold,
who wipes the miser os his darling gold,

And grave Silenus, with instructive nod

· Giving wise lecturos to his pupil god.

From well-known tales such fictions would Ι ram·
As all might hope to imitate with ease3
Yet while they strive the same success to gain,
Should find their labour and their hopes are vain
Such grace can order and connexion give ς
Such beauties common subjects may receive.

Let not the wood-born satyr fondly sport
With amoxous verses, as if bred at contu
Nor yet with wauton Jests, ln mirthful vein,
