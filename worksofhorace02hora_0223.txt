THE ΛΒΤ OF ΡΟΕΤΒΥ, '21:22

So the salse raptures of a flauerer’s an

Exceed the praises of an honest beart.
Menai-ebs, 'tis saidi with many a flowing bow}

Search through the deep recesses os his seul,

W'hom for their future friendship they design,

And put him to the torture in his wine3

So try, whene'er you write, the deep disguise‚

Beneath whose flattering smiles salse Renard lior„
Read to Quintilius, and at every line—

¹‘ Correct this passage, friend, and that refine.’'

Tell him, you tried it twice or thrice in vain*

²⁴ Haste to an anvil with your ill-form'd strain,

Or blot it out.‘' But ifyou still defend

The savourite fully. rather than amend,

He'll say no more, no idle toil employ—

⁴‘ Yourself unrival'd, and your works enj0y2÷
An honest critic, when dull lines move sloxz ,

Or harshly rude,'wi]1 his resentment show;

Mark every fault, and with his pen efface

What is not polish'd to its highest grace 3

Prune all ambitious ornaments away,

And teach you on th' obscure to pour the day -,

Will mark the doubtful phrase with hand severe.

Nor say, F οι· trifies why should I displeaso

The man 1 love Ρ sor trifles such as these

To serious mischiefs lead the man Ι love,

Jf once the flatterer's ridicule he prove.

From a mad poet, whosoe’er is wise‚

As from a leprosy‚ or jaunffloe, flies:

Religious madness in its zealous suain,

Nor the wild phrensy of a moon-struck hrain,

Are hals so dreadful: yet the boys pursue him,

And sools unknowing os their danger, view hin-1,
