He wants sor ever, who would more acquire ;
Set certain limits to your wild desire.
The man, who envies, must behold with pain
Another's joys, and sicken at his¹ gain:
Nor could Sicilia's tyrants- ever find
A greater torment than an envious mind.

Subdue the tyram, and in setters bind.
The docile colt is sorm’d with gentle skin
To move obedient to his rider‘s will.
In the laud hall the hound is taught to bay
The buck-skin trail'd‚ then challenges his prey
Through the wild woods. Thus, in your hour σῖ

From pure instruction quaff the words of truth,
The odours of the wine, that first shall stain
The virgin vesse1‚ it shall long retain.
