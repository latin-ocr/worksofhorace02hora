178 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Our youth, our senators, with bays are crown'd,
And rhimes eternal at our feasts go round.
Even Ι, who verse and all its works deny,
Cau saithless Parthia’s lying sons out-lie,
And, ere the rising sun displays his light,
I call for tablets, papers, pens, and-write.

A pilot only dares a vessel steer;
A doubtful drug unlicens’d doctors fear;
Musicians are to sounds alone confin'd,
And each mechanic harh his trade assign’d ι
But every desperate blockhead dares to write ς
Verso is the trade of every living wight.

And yet this wandering phrensy os the brain
Hath many a gentle virtue in its traiu.
No cares of wealth a poet’s beart contr0u13
Verse is the only passion of his soul.
He laughs at losses, flight of slaves, or fires3
No wicked scheme his honest breast inspioes
To hurt his pupil, or his friend betray3
Brown bread and roots his appetite allay3
And though unfit for war‘s tumultuous trade,
In peace his gentle talents are display'd,
If you allow, that things of trivial weight
May yet support the grandeur osa state.

He forms the infant's tongue to finner sound⁷
Nor suffers vile obscenity to wound
His tendet ears3 then with the words of truth
Corrects the passions and the pride of youth.
Th‘ illustrious dead, who fill his sacred page,
Shine forth examples to each rising age3
The languid hour of poverty be cheers,
And the sick wretch his voice of comfort hears,
