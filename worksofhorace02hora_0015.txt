Deep in the earth to flide thy weight of wealth?
Miser.

One sarthing lessen'd‚ you the mass reduce.
Horace.

And if not lessen’d, whence can rise its use ?

No more than he who never felt the weight.

Or say, what difl'erence, if we live cofifin’d

‘Whether a thousand acres of demesne,

Or one poor hundred, yield sufficient grain?

Fearless of death, and quaff his water pure.
Some, self-deceiv’d‚ who think their lust osgold
