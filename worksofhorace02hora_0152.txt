144 THE WoRKS OF HORACE.

Yet there you gladly fix your future lot,
Your friends sorgetting, by your friends for·goe;
Enjoy the calm of life, and, safe on shore,
At distance hear the raging9tempest roar.
A traveller, though wet with dirt and rain,
would not sor ever at an iun remain,
Or chill‘d with cold, and joying in the heat
Of a warm bath, believe his bliss complete.
Though by strong winds your bark were tempesff
rost,
Say, would you sell it on a distant coast?
Believe me, at delicious Rhodes to. live .
To a sound mind no greater bliss can give,
Than a thick coat in summer's burning ray,
Or a light mantle on a snowy day,
Or to a swimmer Tiber's freezing stream,
Or sunn y rooms in August's mid-day flame.
While yet 'tis in your power3 while Fortune smiles:
At Rome with rapture vaunt those happy isles,
Then with a grateful hand the bliss receive,
Is heaven an hour more fortunate shall give.
Seize on the present j0y, and thus possess,
Where'er you live, an inward happiness
If reason only can our cares allay,
Not the bold site, that wide commands the sea'3
If they, who through the venturous ocean range,
Not their own passions, but the climate change3
Anxious through seas and land to search for test
Is but laborious idleness at best.
1 n desert Ulubrae the bliss you'll find,
lfyou preserve a firm andequal mind.
