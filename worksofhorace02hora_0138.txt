180 THE WoRKS OF HORACE,

The madman, and the fool, whose sordid care
Makes himself poor to enrich a worthless heir.
Give me to drink, and, crown’d with flowers, despise
The grave disgrace of being thought unwise.
What cannot wine perform? It brings to light
The secret soul; it bids the coward fight ς
Gives being to our hopes, and from our hearts
Drives the dull sorrow, and inspires new arts.
Is there a wretch, whom bumpers have not taught
A flow of words, and lostiuess of thought?
Even in th' oppressive grasp of poverty
It can enlarge, and bid the sou] be free.
Cheerful my usual task I undertake-
ζ And no mean figure in my office make,)
That no foul linen wrinkle up the nose ς
That every plate with bright reflexion shows
My guest his face3 that none, when life grows gay„
The sacred hour of confidence betray.
That all in equal friendship may unite,
Your Butra and Septicius l'llinvite,
And, is he's not engag'd to better cheer,
Or a kind girl, Sabinus shall be here.
Still there is roorn, and yet the summer-'s beat
May prove offensive, if the crowd be great:
But write me word, how many you desire,
Then instant from the busy world retire3
And while your tedious clients fin the han.
Elin out at tho back-door, and bilk them ull.
