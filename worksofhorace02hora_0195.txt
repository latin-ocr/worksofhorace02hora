EPISTLES, BOOK 11. 137

-· Α n't please you, captain, let another trudge it 2
rhe man may venture, who has lost his budgew
It chanc'd, at Rome, that 1 was early taught
What woes to Greece enrag'd Achilles wrought ς

Indulgent Athens then improv'd my parts,
With some small tincture of ingenuous ans,
Fair truth from falsehood to discern, and rove
- In search os wisdom through the museful grove.
But lo! the time, destructive to my peace,

Me rudely ravish'd from that charmiug place ς
The rapid tide ofcivil war a-main

Swept into arms, unequal to sustain

The might ofCaesar Dread Philippi's field
First clipt my wings, and taught my pride to yield.
My fortune ruin'd, blasted all my views,

Bold hunger edg'd, and want inspir'd my Muse.
But say, what dose could purisy me, blest

With store sufficient, should l break my rest

To scribble verse? The waning years apaet-
Steal off our thoughts, and rifle every grace.
Alas! already have they snatch'd away
„My jokes, my loves, my revellings, and play.
They strive to wrest my poems from me too,
Instruct me then what method to pursue.

In short, the race of various men admit-e

As various numbers: thee the soster lyre
Delights: this man approves the tragic strain .-
'Phat joys in Bion‘s keen, satir-ic vein.

Ι have three guests invited to a feast,

,Xnd all appear to have a different taste.

What shall l give them? What shall 1 refuse Ξ
What one dislikes, the other two shall choose.
