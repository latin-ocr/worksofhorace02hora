SATIRES, BOOK ΙΙ. 105

Must tie you neck and heels; you seem so blest⁷
When with no humper-invitation ptest.
ssut should Maecenas bid his poet wait
(Goeat folks, likeahim, can never sup till late,)

And leave the sair-one with uninjur’d fame,
N or shall one jealous care disturb my meast,
By whom the wauton shall be next possesst.
When you throw off those ensigns of your pride,
Your ring, your judge’s robe, and basely hide,
Beneath a slave's vile cap, your essenc'd hair,
