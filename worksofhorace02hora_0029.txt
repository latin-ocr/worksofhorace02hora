what we should wise pur-sue, or cautious fly3
iret can she never, with a constant eye,
,Of legal justice mark each nice extreme ς
Nor can right reason prove the crime the same,
To rob a garden, or, by sear unaw’d,

who scarce deserv'd the lash.—l cannot sear,

While you assert al] vices are the same ς
And threaten, that were yours the power supreme-2,
Robbers and thieves your equat tage should feel,
Uprooted by the same avenging steel.

And reigus a monarch. though without a throne:

Horace.
