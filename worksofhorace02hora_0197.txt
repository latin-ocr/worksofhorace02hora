EPISTLES, BOOK 11. 139

Toss'd by the noisy tempest up and down,
Can 1, though even the willing Muse inspire,
Adapt hernumbers to the sounding lyre?

A wight there was, sor rhetoric renown’d‚
Whose brother was a lawyer most profound3
In mutual praise all honours were their own,
And this a Gracchus, that a Mucius shone.
What milder phrensy goads the rhiming train?
Mine is the lyre ς in elegiae strain
He sooths the soul. A wondrous work is mine!
And his—was surely polish'd by the Niue!

With what an air os true poetic pride
And high disdain, we view from side to side
Apollo's temple, as if we ourselves,

And none but we. should fill the vacant shelves ἶ
Then follow further, is your time permits,

And at a distance hear these mighty wits;
How far entitled to this mutual praise,

Which freely gives, and arrogates the bays.
Like gladiators‚ who, by canule-light,

Prolong the conibet, for with soils they right,
With mimic rage we ,rusb upon the foe,
Wounded we wound‚ and measure blow for mou.
Alcaeus l in his opinion shine‚

He soars a new Callimachus in mine;

Or is Mimnermus be his nobler fame,

He struts and glories in the darling name.

Much Ι endur’d‚ when writing l would bribc
The public voice, and sooth the sretful tribe
Of rival poets. Now my rhiming heat
[s cool‘d, and reason re-assu mes her seat,

I boldly bar mine ears¹ against the breed
Of babbling bai-ds, who without mercy read.
