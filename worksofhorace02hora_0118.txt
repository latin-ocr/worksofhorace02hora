110 THE WORKS OF HORACE. ᾖ

This dish remov'd, a slave expett and able ,ἱ *4
With purple napkin wip'd a maple table.
Another sweeps the fragments of the feast,
That nothing useless might offend the guest.

At Ceres' feast as Attic virgin walks
Solemn and slow, so black Hydaspes stalks
With right Caecubiau‚ and the wines of Graece--
Of foreign growth, that never cross'd the seas.
If Alban and Falernian please you more,

ῑ So says our host, you may have both good stote ς
Poor wealth indeed——

Horace.

But tell me, who were there,
Thus happy to enjoy such luscious fare ?

Fundanius.

On the first bed Thurinus lay between

Varius and me, ifhaply right I ween ς

Servilius and Vibidius both were there,

Brought by Maecenas, and with him they share

The middle bed. Our master of the feast

On the third couch, in seat of honour plac’d,

Porcius betwixt and Nomentanus lles;

Porcius, who archly swallows custard-pies.
Whate’er of curious relish lay unknown

Is by Nomentane with his finger shown ς

For we, poor folk, unknowing of our feast,

Eat fish and wild-sowl—of no common taste.

ἒ But he, to prove how luscious was the neat,

With a broil'd flounder’s entrails crowds my plato,

Then tells me, apples are more ruddy bright,

lt gathered by sair Luna’s waning light.
