EPISTLES, BOOK 11. 181

Farewell the stage3 sor humbly 1 disclaim
Such fond pursuits of pleasure, or os fame,
Is 1 must sink in shame, or swell with pride,
As the gay palm is granted, or denied:
And sure the hard, though resolutely bold,
NIust quit the stage, or tremble to behold
The little vulgar of the clamorous pit,
'Phough void of honour, virtue, sense, or wit,
When his most interesting soenes appear,
Call sor a prize-fight, or a baited bear3
And should the knights forbid their dear delight‚
They rise tumultuous‚ and prepare for fight.
But even our knights from wit and genius fly
ro pageant shows, that charin the wandering eye.
Drawn aro the soenes, ancl lo ! for many an hour
Wide o'er tho stage the flying squadrons pour.
Then kings in chains confess the fate of war,
And weeping queens attend the victor’s car.
Chairs‚ couches, carts, in rattling rout are romi.
And ships os mighty bulk their sails unsold.
At last the model of some captive towns,
In ivory built, the splendid triumph crowns.
Sure, if Democritus were yet on earth,
Whether a beast of mix'd and monstrous birth
Bid them with gaping admiration gaze,
Or a white elephant their wonder mise,
The crowd would more delight the laughing sago,
Thau all the farce and follies of the stage,
To think, that asses should in judgment sit,
In solid deafness, on the works of wit.
For where’s the voice so strong as to confound
The shouts with which our theatres resound?
Loud as when surges lash the Tuscan shore,
