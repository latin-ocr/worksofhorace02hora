EPISTLES, BOOK 11. 179

Did not the Muse inspire the poet’s lays,
How could our youthful choir their voices raisc
In prayer harmonious, while the gods attend,
And gracious bid the fruitful shower desceud3
Avert their pingues, dispel each hostile sear,
And with glad harvests crown the wealthy year?
Thus can the sound of all-melodious lays
Th' offended powers of heaven and hell appease.
Our ancient swains‚ of vigorous, frugal kind,
At harvest-home us’d to unbend the mind
With festa] sports 3 those sports, that bade them bear,
With cheersul hopes, the labours os the year.
Their wives and children shar'd their hours of mirth‚
Who shar‘d their toils ς when to the goddess Earth
Grateful they sacrific'd a teerning swine,
And pour’d the milky bowl at Sylvan's shrine.
Then to the Genius of their fleeting hours,
Mindful of life's short date, they offer’d wine and
flowers.
Here, in alternate verse, with rustic jest
The clowns their awkward raillery express'd‚
And as the year brought round the jovial day,
Freely they sported‚ innocently gay,
'l'ill cruel wit was turn'd to open tage,
And dar'd the noblest families engage.
When some, who by its tooth envenom'd bled,
Complain’d aloud‚ and others, struck with dread,
Though yet untouch'd‚ as in a public cause,
Implor’d the just protection of the laws,
Which from injurious libels wisely guard
Our neighbour's same ς and now the prudent bard,
Whom the just terrors os the lash restrain, .
Το pleasure and instruction turns his vein.
