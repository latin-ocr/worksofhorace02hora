108 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Yet Davus is with rogue and rascal grac'd,
But you're a critic, and a man of taste.

Ι am, forsooth. a good-for-nothing knave,

When by a smoking pasty made a slave:

In you it shows a soul erect and great,

Is you refuse even one luxurious treat. .

Why may not I, like you, my guts obey ,7-

“ My shoulders for the dear indulgence pay.”

But should not you with heavier stripes be taught,
Who search for luxuriesz, how dearly bought !
For soon this encssess, this repeated feast,

Its relish lost, shall pall upon the taste3

'I'hen shall your trembling limbs refuse the weight
Of a vile caroass with disease replete.

How seldom from the lash a slave escapes,
Who trucks some trifle, that he stole, sor grapes!
And shall we not the servile glutton rate,

To please his throat who sells a good estate?
You cannot spend one vacant hour alone;

You cannot make that vacant houi· your own.

A sels-deserter from yourself you stray‚

And now with wine, and now with sleep, allay
Your cares : in vain; companions black as night:
Thy pressing cares, arrest thee in thy ssight.

Horace.
Is there no stone?
Davus.
At whom, good sir. to throw it τ’
Horace.
H ave 1 no dan?
