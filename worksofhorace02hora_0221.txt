mie ART OF POETRY. 213

'Phe bounding hall, round quoit, or. whissing troque,
Win not the laughter of the crowd provoke:
But every desperate blockhead dares to write-
Why not ? His fortune's large to makea knight3
The man's free-born 3 perhaps. of gentle strain:
His character and manners pure from stain.

But thou, dear Piso. never tempt the Wluse,
If wisdom's goddess shall her aid refuse3
And when you write, let candid Metius hear,
Or try your labours on your father's ear,
Or even on mine ; but let them not come forth
Till the ninth ripening year mature their worth.
You may correct what in yourclosel lies:
Is publish'd, it irrevocably flies.

The wood-born sace of men when Orpheus tam'd.
From neotus and- from mutual blood reclaim’d,
T his priest divine was fabled to assuage
The tiger’s fiemeness, and the lion's tage.

Thus rose the Theban wa113 Amphion’s lyre

And soothing voice the listengng stenes inspiro.
poetic wisdom mark’d, with happy mean,

Public and private; sacred aud profane ;

The wandeting joys ot'lawiess love suppress'd ;
With equa] rites the wedded couple bless’d:
Plann'd future town& and instituted laws:

So verse became divine, and poets gain’d applausu

Homer, Tyrtaeus, hy the Muse inspir‘d,

To deeds ofanns the martial spirit fir’d. =

In verse the eracles divine were heard,

And uature’s secret laws in verse declar'dz
Monareh’s were courted in l'ierian sti-ain,
And coinic sports reliev'd the wearied swain-7
Apollo sings, the Muses tune the lyre;

'l'hen blush not sor an art which they inspiro.
