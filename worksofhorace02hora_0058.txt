Calvus, Catullus better suit their vein,

Whose wauton songs they charit in tunifful stram.
But yet a mighty seat it must be thought-—

So oft persorm'd by yonder Rhodian hard.

(As Chian sostens the Falernian wine) ,
At least in verse.’' But say, my rhiming friend,
Were you that thies Petillius to defend,
While otherlawyers sweated in the cause,
And urg’d in pure Latinitx the laws :
While wondering crowds upon their language huogo
