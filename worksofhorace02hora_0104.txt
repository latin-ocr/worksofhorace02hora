To have and hold them for my life.
If 1 was never known to raise

My fortune by dishonest ways,

Nor, like the spendthrifts of the timeS‚

Shall ever sink it by my crimes:

If thus 1 neither pray nor ponder—

Oh Β might 1 have that angle yonder‚

Which disproportions now my field,

What satisfaction it would yield !

O that. some lucky chance but threw

A pot of silver in my view,

As lately to the man, who bought

The very land in which he wrought!

If I am pleas‘d with my condition,

⁷ Ο hear, and grant this last petition:

Indulgent, let my cattle hatten,

Let all things, but my fancy, fanen,

And thou continue still to guard,

As thou art wont, thy suppliant bard.
VVhenever therefore Ι retreat

From Rome into my Sabine seat,

By mountains fenc'd on either side, ·

And in my eastle sortified,

What can I write with greater pleasure‚

Than satir-es in familiar measure?

N or mad ambition there destroys,

Nor sickly wind my health annoys;

Nor noxious autumn gives me paiu‚:.

The ruthless undertaker's gain.
whatever title please thine ear,

Father of morning, J anus, hear,

Cim-e morial men, by heaven’s decree5
