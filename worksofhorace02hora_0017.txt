summ, BOOK 1. ‚9

Your wealth shall purchase some good-natur’d
friend

Your cordials to prepare, your couch attend,

And urge the doctor to preserve your life,

And gIve you to your children and your wife.

Horace.

Nor wife, nor son. that hated life would save,

While all. who know thee wish thee in the grave.

And canst thou wonder that thev prove uukind, ¹

When all thy passions are to gold eonfin’d?
Nature? 'tis true in each relation gave

A friend sincere.- yet what you thus receive,

If you imagine with unfeeliug heart

And careless manners to preserve, your art

As well may teach an uss to scour the plain,

And bend obedient to the forming rein.
Yet somewhere should your views of lucre cease,

Nor let your fears of poverty increase,

As does your wealth; sor. since you now possess

Your utmostish‚ your labour should be less.
Ummidius once (the tale is quickly told,)

So wondrous rich. he measur'd out his gold,

Yet never dress’d him better than a slave,

Asraid of starving ere he reaeh‘d his grave:

But a bold wench, of right virago suain,

Clest with an axe the wretched wight in twaiu.

stliscr,
By your advice. what party shall Ι take?

Like Maenius live a prodigal, and take
Like Nomentanus ?
