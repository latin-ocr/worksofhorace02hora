310 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

'Lot me the poet's worth and office show,
And whence his true poetic riches flow;
What forms his genius. and improves his vein L
What well or ill becomes each different seenw,
How high the knowledge os his art amends,

And to what saults his ignorance extends.

Good sense, that fountain os the Muse's art,
Let the strong page of Socrates impert,

And if the mind with clear conceptions glow,
The willing words in just expressions flow.

The poet, who with nice discernment knows
“What to his country and his friends he owes;
How various nature warnis the human breast,
To love the parent, brother, friend, or guest:
What the great offiees ofjudges are,
of senators, of generals sent to war3
He surely knows, with nice, well-judging art.
The strokes peculiar to each different part.

Keep nature's great origInal in view,

And thence the living images pursue3

For when the sentiments and diction please,
And all the characters are wrought with ease,
Your play, though void of beauty, force, and art,
More strongly shall delight, and warm the heart,
Thau where a liseless pomp of verse appears,
And with sonorous trifles charms our ears.

Το her lov'd Greeks the Muse indulgent gave,
To her lov'd Greeks, with greatness to conceive,
Audin sublimet tone their language raise—

Her Greeks were only cavetous of praise.
Our youth, proficients in a nobler art,
Divide a farthing to the hundredth part ε, 7'2‘ μ’
