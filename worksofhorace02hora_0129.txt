EPISTLES, BOOK 1. 121

Tra rich lord‚ in wanton rapture, eries,
what place on earth with charming Baiae vies!
Soon the broad lake and spreading sea shall prove
Th’ impatient whims of his impetuous love3
But if his fancy point some other way
(Which like a sign from heaven he must obey,)
Instant, ye builders, to Teanum haste,

ζ An inland country is his lordships taste.

Knows he the genial bed, and fruitful wife?

⁴‘ Oh! then the bliss of an unmarried life !'’

Is he a bacheler? the on'ly blest,
He swears, are of the bridal joy possest.
S‘ay, while he changes thus, what chains can binc]
Τ hese various forms 3 this Proteus of the mind?
But now to lower objects turn your eyes,
And lo 3 what soenes of ridicule arise !
The poor, in mimicry of heart, presumes
To change his barbers‚ baths, and beds and rooms,
And, since the rich in their own barges ride,
He hires a boat aud pukes in mimic pride.
[f some unlueky barber notch my hair,
Or if my robes of different length I wear;
ls my new vest a tatter'd shirt confess,
You laugh to see such quarrels in my dress:
But if my judgment, with itself at strife.
Should contradict my general course os life;
Should now despise what it with· warmth pursu'd,

⁴And earnest wish sor what with scorn it view’d;

- Float like the tide; now high the building raise;

Now pull it down ς nor round nor square can please
You call it madness of the usual kind,
Nor langii, nor think trustees should be assign'd

To manage my estate3 nor seem afraid,
