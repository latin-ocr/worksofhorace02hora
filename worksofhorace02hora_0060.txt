'132 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Ur whether in his subject lies the-fault,

Or in himself, that they’re not higher wrought:¹⁴

Thau if the art os verse were to confine

In ten low feet a cold, dull length of line,

Content his rhiming talents to display

In twice an hundred verses twice a day.

Such, Cassius, thy rapidity of song,

Which like a foaming river pour'd along,

l'Vhose volum'd works (if Fame be not a liar)

'Kindled around thy corpse the funeral fite.
Lucilius ranies with poli'ter ease

T han all the rhiming tribe of ancient days,

Nay more correct than him (I frankly own)

Who form'd this kind of verse, o Greece unknown τ

Yet, were he fateci to the present age,

He sure had blotted the redundant page3

Prun'd all luxuriant excellence away,

And, while he labour'd o'er th' instructive lay. ’

W ould often scratch his head in dull despair,

And to the quick his nails bemusing tear. ι
Would you a reader's just esteem engage?

Correct with frequent care the blotted page ;

Nor strive the wonder os the crowd to raise,

But the few better judges leam to please.

Be thine, fond madman, some vile school to choos<

WVhere to repeat the labours of your Muse,

While 1, like hiss’d Arbuscula unaw’d,

Dcspise the vulgar, since the knights applaud.
Say, shall that bug Pantilius move my spleen Ρ

Shall Ι be tortur’d, when a wretch obscene,

Or foolish Fannius, for a sordid treat

with sweet Tigellius, shall my verses rate ³
