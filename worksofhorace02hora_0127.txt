Emeum, Boon 1, 119

'she wretch of sloth, its excellence shall prove·
Fierceness itself shall hear its tage away,
When listning calmly to th' instructive lay. ’
Even in our ssight from vice some virtue lie33
³ And free from folly, we to wisdom rise.
Α little fortune, and the foul disgrace
To urge in vain your interest for a place;
V These are the ills you shu‘n with deepest dread ς
'With how much labour both os beart and head?
That worst of evils, poverty‚ to sbun,
Dauntless through seas and rocks, and fires you tuit
To surthest Ind, yet heedless to attend
'To the calm lecturos of some wiser friend,
who bids you scorn what now you most desire,
And with an idiot's ignorance admire.
What strolling gladiator would engage
For vile applause to mount a country-stage,
who at the Olympio gemes could gain ,renown‚
And without danger bear away the crowu?
Silver to gold, we own. should yield the prim.
ι And gold to virtue; louder Folly eries,
Ye sons osRome, let money first be sought3
Virtue is only worth a second thought.
This maxim echoes through the bankers' street,
While young and oldthe pleasing strain repeat:
For though you boast a larger fund ofsense,
Unta'mted morals, honour, eloquenee,
Yet want a little os the sum that buys
The titled honour, and you ne’er shall riae ς
Yet is you want the qualifying right
Of such a fortune to be made a knight,
You're a plebeium still. Yet children sing,
Amid their spons, ⁴⁸ Do right, and be a kings’
