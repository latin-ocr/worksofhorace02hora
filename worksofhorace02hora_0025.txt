SATIRES‚ BOOK Ι. 1Τ’

“ Has Horace, then, no vices of his own ?''’
That Ι have vices. frankly 1 confess.
But of a different kind. and somewhat less.
Maenius, behind his back, at Novius rass'd,
‘⁶ What! don't you know yoursels, or think conceal'd
Fiom us, who know you, what a life you live ?”
Maenius replies‚ Indulgent, I forgive

Ἴ The fomes 1 comunt. T his foohsh love

' - And criminaL our censure should reprove.
For wherei'orc, while you carelessly pass by
Your own worst vices with unheezling eye,
Why so sharp-sighted in another's fame,
Strong as an eagle's ken, or dragon's bearn ?
But know, that he with equa} spleen shall view,
With equa] rigonr shall your saults pursuc. ’“

Your friend is passionate3 perhaps unfit

F or the brisk petulence of modern wit.
His hair ill-cutsshis robe t'nat akaward flows‚

’ Or his large shoes, to rmllery expose
The man you love; yet is he not possest
Os virtues. with which very few are blest?
While underneath this rude, uncouth disguisc
A genius os extensix e knowledge lies.

Search your own breem, and mark with hones:
care

What seeds of souy nature planted there,
Or Custom rais'd ς sor an uncultur'd field
Shan for the fire its thorns and thistles yield.
And yet a shorter method we may find,
As lovers, to their fair-one fondly blind,
³⁴⁹ Even on her foulness can delighted gaze 3
' For Hagne's wen can §md Balbinus please.

ιθ Oh! were our weakness to our friends the same,-
