SATIRES, BOOK 11. ὅθ

Unbappy bard, to sure contempt you run ;
¹ Then learn the Siren Indolence to shun‚
> Or poorly be content to lose the fame,
[3 Which your past hours of better life might claim ›

ι Horace,

j, Sage Damasippus, may the powers divine,
For this same excellent advice of thine,
Give thee a barber, in their special grace,

To nurse your beard, that wisdorn of the face2!
Yet, prithee. teu me whence l'm so well known.-

Damasippus.

When 1 had lost all business os my own,

And at th’ Exchange my ship-wreck'd foi-tunes broke„
1 minded the affairs of other folk.

In rate antiques full curious was my taste3
Here the rude chissels rougher strokes Ι trac’d ’γ
In flowing brass a vieious hardness found,

Or bought a statue sor five hundred pound‚

A perfect connoisseur. At gainful rate,

1 purchas’d gardens, or a mansion-seat.

Thus, through the city 1 was known to fame,
And Mercury's favourite my public name.

Horace.

1 knew your illness, and amaz’d behold
‘Your sudden cure.

⁷ Damasippus.

A new disease expell'd
My old disorder: as when changing paine
Fly to the stomach from the head and teins.
Thus the lethargia, staning from his bed,
In boxing phrensy broke his doctor's head.
