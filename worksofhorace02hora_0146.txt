At mom an early client, and at night 1
Α certain guest, his project to complete, “
He takes him with him to his country-seut: '
On horseback now he ambies athis ease, 4
The soil, the climate, his incessant praise. μ’

Philip, who well observ'd our simple guest,
Laughs in his sleeve, resolv'd to have his jest
At any rate 3 then lends him fifty pound‚
And promis'd fifty more, to buy a spot of ground,

But, that our tale no longer be delay'd,
Bought is the ground, and our spruce merchant macte ,

Α very rustic ς now, at endless rate, ε
Vineyards and furrows are his constant prate. ζ ”
He plants his elms sor future vines to rise, Δ*

Grows old with care, and on the prospect dies,
But when bis goats by sickness, and by thieves ,
His sheep are lost, his crop his hope deceives, fi
When his one ox is kill'd beneath the yoke,
Such various losses his best spirits broke-
At midnight dragging out his only horse,
He drives to Philip's house his desperate course :¹ 5
who, when he saw him rough‚ deform'd with hair,
‘⁴ Your ardent love of pels, your too much care
Hath surely brought you to this dismal plightf’m
Oh ! call me wretch, ifyou would eall me right*2
But let this wreich your clemency implore.
By your good genius ς by each heavenly power ; ¹¹
By that right hand, sure never pledg'd in vain, -⁴
Restore to me my former lif? again.
To his first state let him return with speed,
'Who sees how far the joys he lest exceed
His present choice ε sor all should be confin⁹d
Wilh'm the boundss which nature harh assign'd'
