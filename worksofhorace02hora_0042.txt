34 THE WORKS 01³· HORACE.

(Because low-bom) the honours of the state,
shall we from thence their vice or virtuerate ἓ
Were I expell'd the senate-house with scom
J ustly‚ perhaps, because thus meanly born
Ι fondly wander'd fr0m my native sphere3
Yet shall I with less real‘worth appear?
Chain'd to her beamy car, Fame drags along
The mean, the great, an undistinguish‘d throng.
Poor Tillius, when compell’d in luckless hour
To quit your purple robe and tribune's power,
A larger share of envy was thy fate, ⁷
Which had been lessen’d in a private state.
For in black sandals when a coxcomb's diest,
When floats the robe impurpled down his breast,
Instant, “ What man is this?” he round him hears,
And who his father?” As when one appears
Sick of your sever, Barrus to desire
That all the world his beauty should admire‚
Anxious our girls inquire, “ What mien and air,
What leg and soot he has, what teeth and hair 5⁸·
So he, who promises to guard the state,
The gods, the temples, and th' imperial seat,
Makes every mortal ask his father's name,
And not less curlous of his mother's fame.
‘⁶ And shall a Syrian's son, like you presume
To hurl the free-born citizens of Rome
From the Tarpeian rock’s tremendous height.
Or to the hangman Cadmus give their sate ?”
Tillius.

My coneague sits below me one degree;
For Novius, like my⁴ er, was made free
orace.

Shall you for this a true Messala seem,
