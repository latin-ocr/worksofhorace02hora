SATIRES, BOOK Ι.

het Plotius, Varius, and Maecenas deign
With virgil, Valgius, to approve my strain3
[m good Octavius even endure my lays ς
Let Fuscus read, and either Viscus praise3
leet me, with no mean arts to purchase same,

Let Bibulus and Servius be my own,
And Furnius for a critie’s candour known 3

Among my learned friends are many more,
‘whose names 1 pass in modest silence o‘er:

These I can wish to smile; enjoy their praise 3

Of minstrel scholam, and' 1n sighing stram,
With sost Hermogenes these rhimes deplore-
