SATIRES, BOOK Ι.

the blushing M00n‚ to shun the sight,
nehind a tomb withdrew her light.
oh! if Ι lie, may raven’s shed
Their 01dure on my sacred head 2
May tbieves and prostitutes and rakes
Beneath my nose erect a jakes !
. Not to be tedious, or repeat
‘How flats and sharps in concert meet,

⁹ With which the ghosts and hags maintain

A dialogue os passing straim
Or how, to hide the tooth of snake

And beard of wolf, the ground they break:

Or how the fire of magio seiz’d
The waxen form, and how it blaz'd;
Mark! how my vengeance 1 pursu’d
For all Ι heard, sorau Ι view’d.

Loud as a bladder bursts its wind
Dreadsul I thunder’d from behind.
To town they scamper'd struck with sear,
This lost her teeth, and that her hair.

They dropp'd the bracelets from their amm

Their incantations, herbs and chax-ms 3
Whoe'er had seen them in their night
Had burst with laughing at the sight.
