SATIRES, BOOK 1. 29

And wast, though not with much good humour wait‚
While with keen appetites my comrades eat.

The Night o’er the earth now spread her dusky

shade‚

And through the heavens her starry train display’d 3
What time, between the slaves and boatmen rise
Quarrels osclamorous rout. The boatman eries,
“ Step in, my masters ;’' when with open throat,
‘⁴ Enough, you scoundre13 will you sink the boat ?‘·'
Thus, while the mule is hamess’d, and we pay
Our sreigffls, an hour in wrangling slips away.

The fenny frogs with croakings hoarse and deep,
And gneus, loud buzzing, drive away our sleep.
Drench’d in the lees of wine, the wat'ry swain
And passenger in loud alternate strain
Chant forth the absent sair¹ who warms his breas1,
Tin wearied passenger retires to rest.

Our clumsy bargeman sends his mule to gram,
And the tough cable to a rock belays,

'I'hen snores supine: but when at rising light

Our boat stood still, up starts a hare-brain'd wight ς
With sallow cudgel breaks the bargeman’s pate,
And bangs the mule at a well-favour’d rate.
Thence onward labouring with a. world of pain,
At ten, Feronia, we thy sountain gain :

There land and bathe3 then after dinner creep
Three tedious miles, and climb the rocky steep
Whence Anxur sbines. Maecenas was to meet
Cocceius here. to settle things of weight;

For they had ost in embassy been join’d,

And reconcil’d the masters of mankind.

Here while I bath’d my eyes with cooling ointment
They both arriv'd according to appointment ς
