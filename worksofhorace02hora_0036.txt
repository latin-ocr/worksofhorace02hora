ΞΒ THE WORKS OF HORACE.

For in my bed, or in the colonnade

Sauntering, Ι call reflectien to my aid.

‘⁴ This was well done. Here happiness attends.

This conduct makes me pleasing to my friends.

VVere that man’s actions of a beauteous kind?

Oh! may 1 never be to such inclin'd !” '
Thus, silently [ talk my conduct o'er,

01· trifle with the Muse an idle hour3

For which, among my frailties, 1 demand

Forgiveness, and shall call a powerful band,

If you refuse‚ of poets to my aid

(Well fraught with numbers is the rhiming trade)

To force you, like the proselyting Jews,

To be, like us, a brother of the Muse.

SATIRE V.

LEAVING imperial Rome, my course Ι steer
To poor Aricia, and its moderate cheer.
From all the Greeks, in rhetorician lore,
The prize of learning my companion bore.
To-Forum-Appii thence we steer, a place ·
Stust'd with rank boatmen, and with vintners base,
And laggard into two days' journey broke
What were but one to less-incumber'd folk :
The Appian mad, however, yields most pleasure
To those who choose to travel at their leisure.
The water here was of so foul a stream
Against my stomaeh 1 awai· proclaim.
