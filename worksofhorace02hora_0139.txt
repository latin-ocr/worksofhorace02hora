To N UMICIUS.

NOT to admire, is of all means the best,

'she only means, to make, and keep us blest.
There are, untainted with the thoughts of sear,

Who see the various changes of the year

Unerring roll: who see the glorious sun,

And the fix’d stass, their annual progress run :

But with what different eye do they behold

'The gifts os earth; or diamonds or g01d3

Old ocean’s treasures, and the pearly stores,

wasted to furthest India’s wealthy shores?

Or with what sense, what language, should we gaze

ΟΩ shows, employments, or the people's praise ἓ
Whoever dreads the opposite extreme

Os disappointment, poverty‚ or shame,

Is raptur'd with almost the same desires,

As he who dotes on what the world admires ς

Equal their terrore, equal theh- surprise,

when accidental dangers round them rise.

Nor matters it, what passions fills his breast,

With joy or grief, desire or sear opprest,

'who views, with down-fix’d eyes, life's varying scen&

whose soul grows stiff, and stupified his brain.

Even virtue, when pursu’d with warmth extremm

‘rums into vice, and fools the sage's same. χ
