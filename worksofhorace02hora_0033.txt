SATIRES‚ BOOK Ι. 25

Now tell me, whether satire should appear,
With reason, such an object of your fear.
Sulcius, and Caprius, fiercest of their trade,
HQSG with the virulence with which they plead‚
'When through the streets they stalk with libels
arm ',d
Mark how the thieves and robbers are alarm' d 3
But yet the man of honest hands and pure
May scorn thern both, in innocence secure ε
Or though like Coelius you a villain be,
I’m no informer: whence your fears of me ?
With printers and their sbops I never deal ς
No rubric pillar sets my works to sale,
O'er which the hands of vulgar readers sweat,
Or whose soit strains Tigellius can repeat.
Even by my friends compell’d 1 read my lays,
Nor every place nor every audience please.
F ull many bards the public sorum choose
Where to recite the labours of their-Muse ;
Or vaulted baths‚ that best preserve the sound,
While sweetly floats the voice in echoes round.
The coxcombs never think at whose expense
They thus indulge the dear impertinence.
“ But you in libels‚m1schievous, delight,
And never, but in spleen of genius, write.”
Is there, with whom Ι live, who knows my beart,
Who taught you how to aim this venom'd dart ?
He, who malignam tears an absent friend,
Or, when attack’d by others, don't desend3
Who trivial bursts of laughter strives to raise,
And courts of prating petulence the praise3
Os things he never saw who tells his tale,
And friendship's secrets knows not to conceal,—
