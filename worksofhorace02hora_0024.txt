SATIRE 111.

TO MAECENAS.

WITH this one viee all songsters are possest3
Sing they can never at a froend’s request,
Yet chant it forth, unask'd‚ from morn to night-—
This vice Tigellius carried to its height.
Caesar, who might command in firmet tone,
If, by his father's friendship and his own,
He ask'd a song, was sure to ask in vain,
Yet, when the whim prevail'd, in encssess sti-ain
Through the whole feast the jovial catch he plies,
From bass to treble o’er the gamut flies.

Nothing was firm, or constant, in the man3
He, sometimes, like a frighten coward ran,
Whose soes are at his heels, then solemn stalk’d,
As if at J uno's festival he walk'd.
Now with two hundred slaves he crowds his train ;
Now walks with ten. In high and haughty strain,
At mom, of tetrarchs and of kings he prates3
At night—‘⁶ A three-legg'd table, Ο ye F ates,
A little shell the sacred salt to hold,
And clothes, though coarse, to keep me from the

cold.’‘

Yet give the man, thus fmgal, thus content,
Ten thousand pounds, and every shilling's spent
In five short days. He drank the night away
Till rising dawn, then snored ‘minan the day.
Sure such a various creature ne'er was known.-
