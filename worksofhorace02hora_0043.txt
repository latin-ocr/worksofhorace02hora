SATIRES, BOOK 1. ’ 35,

And⁸risea Paulus in your own esteem ?

But when two hundred waggons crowd the street,
And three long funerals in prooession meet,
Beyond the fises and horns his voice he raises,
And sure such strength of lungs a wondrous praise is

As sor myself, a freed-man’s son contest,

A freed-man’s son, the public soom and jem,
That now with you [joy the social bour,
That once a Roman legion own'd my power3
But though they envied my command in war,
Justly perhaps, yet sure 'tis different far

To gain your friendship‚ where no servile art.
Where only men of merit claim a part.

Nor yet to chance this happiness Ι owe3
Friendship like yours it had not to bestow.
First‚ my best virgil, then my Varius told,
Among my friends what character 1 hold ε
When introduc'd, in few and faltering words
(Such as an infant modesty affords)

I did not tell you my descent was great,
Or thatI wander’d round my country-seat
On a proud steed in richer pastures bred:
But what 1 really waS, Ι frankly said.

'Short was your answer, in your usual strain ,
l take my leave, nor wait on you again,
Tin, nine months past, engag’d and bid to hold
A place among your nearer friends enroll’d.
An honour this, methinks, ofnobler kind,
That innocent of heart and pure os mind,

, Though with no titled birth, I gain'd his love,

whose judgment can discern, whose choice approve
If some few, venial saults deform my soul
ζ Like a fair face when spotted with a mole,)
