SATIRE 111.

DAMASIPPUS. HORACE .

Damasippus.

{F hardly once a quarter-iof a year,
ΞΟ idle grown, a single sheet appear3
isangry at yourself, that sleep and wine
Enjoy your hours, while anxious to refine
1 our labours past, no more your voice you raise
Γο aught, that may desen-ve the public praise,
W· at shall be done? When Saturn’ s jovial feas 1
seem ’(1 too luxuriant to your sober tastu,
⁴{lither you ssed. Then try the pleasing §train-
i'fome on: begin.
Horace.

Alas! 'tis all in vain z
While I with impotence of rage abuse
⁴'3on harmless pens, the guiltless walls accuse3

walls, that seem’d rais'd in angry heaven's despite,

'rue curse os peevish poem, when they write.
Damasippus.

&nd yet you threaten‘ d something wondrous great,
When you should warm you in your country seat.
W hy crowd the volumes of the Grecian sage.
Rang'd with the writers of the comic stage?

'shink you the wrath of envy to appense,-

Your virtue lost in idleness and ease?
