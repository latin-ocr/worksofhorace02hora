:14 THE WORKS OF HORACE

‘Tis long disputed, whether poets claim
From art or nature their best right to fame3
But art, if not enrich'd by nature's vein,
, And a rude genius of uncultur'd strain,
Are useless both ς but, when in friendship join'd‚
<A mutual succour in each other fiind.
A youth, who hopes th' Olympio prize to gain,
All arts must try, and every toil sustah13
Th' extremes of heat and cold must often prove,
And shun the weakening joys of wine and love.
Who sings the Pythie song, first learn'd to raise
Each note distinct, and a stem master please3
But now—“ Since I can write the true sublime,
Curse catch the hindmost !” eries the man of rhime
“ What! in a scienee own myself a foul,
Because, foxsooth, Ι learn'd it not by rule ?''
As artful criers, at a public fair,
Gather the passing crowd to buy their wate3
So wealthy poets. when they deign to write,
To all clear gains their flatterers invite.
But if the feast of Imm-”y they give,
Bau a poor wretch‚ or from distress relieve,
When the black fangs of law around him bend.
How shall they know a flatterer from a friend Ῑ·
If e'er you make a present, or propose
To grant a favour3 while his bosom glows
‘With grateful sentiments of joy and walse,
Never, ah l never let him hear your lays3
Loud shall he cry, How elegant! how fine!
Tqrn pale with wonder at some happier linc.
Distil the civil dew from either eye,
And leep. and beat the ground m ecstasy.
As hirelings, pald sor their funereal tear,

Outweep the sorrows of a friend sincere.
