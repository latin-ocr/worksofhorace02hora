Crispinus.
‘⁴ Pen, ink, and paper-name your place and time :
Then, try, friend Flaccus. who can sastest rhym0.” ’

Horace.

Thank heaven, that form’d me ofan humbler kind ς
No wit‚n9r yet to prattling much inclin’d‚
While thou shalt imitate the wtuds, that blow
From lungs of leather‚ till the metal flow.

Thrice happy Fannius, of his own free grace
Who in Apollo's temple hangs his face,

And gilds his works to v2ew ; while l with sear
Repeat my verses to the public ear 2

Because by few such works as m me are read, .
Conscious osmeriting the lash they dread.
Take me a man. at venture. from the crowd,
And he's amffissous, novemus, or proud.

One burns to madness sor the wedded dame;
Intemperate lusts another’s breast inflame. ·
The silver vase with pleasure one admires,
While Albius o⁷er a bronze antique expires ς
The venturous merchant⁴ from the rising day
To regions warm’d beneath the setting ray,
Like dust collected⁸ by a whirlwind flies

To save his pelf, or bid the mass arise.

All these the poet dread, his rhymes ‹intest-

⁴⁴ Yonder-he drives—avoid that furious beast3
lfhe may have hisjest‚ he never cares

At whose expense, nor his best friend he speres 5
And is he once, in his malignam vein,

The crue] paper with invective stain,

The slaves, who carry water through the street,
To his charm'd ear his verses must repeat-’⁷
