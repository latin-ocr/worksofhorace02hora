118 THE WORKS OF HORACE.
You ask, perhaps, what sect, what ehi-esI own;

Ρη] os all sects, but blindly sworn to none3

For as the tempest drives l shape my way,

Nor active plunge into the world’s wide sea:

Now virtue's precepts rigidly defend, ἃ

Nor to the world—the world to me shall bend: η

'rhen make some looser moralist my guide,

And to a school less iigid smoothly glide. q
, ‚ As night seems tedious to the expecting youth, ’
⁸¹ 'Whose sair-one breaks her assignation truth ς

As to a slave appears the lengthen’d day,

Who owes his task- for he receiv’d his payg

As, when the gaurdian-mother‘s too severe, ⁷

l‘mpatient minors waste their last, long year;

So sadly slow the time ungrateful flows,

Which breaks th' important systems 1 propose ; -

Systems, whose useful precepts might engage

Both rich and poor; both infancy and age ι

But nieaner precepts now my lise must rule,

These, the first rudiments of wisdom's schooL·

You cannot hope for Lynceus' piercing ey‘es:

But will you then a strengthening salve despise ἓ

You wish for matchless Glycon's limbs, in vain,

Yet why not cure the gout‘s decripit pain?

Though of exact perfection you despair,

Yet every step to virtue's worth your care.

Even while you sear to use your present storo,

Yet glows your bosom with a lust of more?

The power of words and soothing sounds can ease

The raging pain and lessen the disease.

Is fame your passion? Wisdom’s powersul chalem,

If thrice read ovet, shall its soree disarm. , ι’
