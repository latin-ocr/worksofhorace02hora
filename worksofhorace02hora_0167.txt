EPISTLES, BOOK 1.

Or of his plunder’d baggage to complain,
Is but the trick‚ which wiiy harlots try,
who for a macelot, or a neelfiam, cry ς

So oft they weep, that we believe no more
When they with tears a real loss deplore.
He, whom a lying lameness once deceives,
No more the falling vagabond believe53

ζ And though with streaming tears the caitiff orie-„2

Help me, ah! cruel, help a wretch to rise;
Though loud he swear, ‘⁶ Indeed my leg is broke.
By great Osiris Ι no longer joke ;”

Yet the hoarse village answers to his criess.

⁶30 find a stranger to belleve your lies¹

ΤΟ LOLLIUS-

LOLLIUS, if well 1 know your beart,

Your liberal spirit scorns an art

That can to sordid flattery bend,

And basely counterseit the friend ς

For such the difference, I ween,

The flatterer and friend between,

As is betwixt a virtuous dame

And prostitute of common same.
Behold, in opposite excess,

A different vice, though nothing less .
