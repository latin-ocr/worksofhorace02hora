SATIRES, BOOK 11. nis

With some pretended joke our laugh was (uest,
servilius ever seconding the Jest‚

When you, great host, &etum with alter’d sace,
As isto mend with art your late disgrace.

The slaves behind in mighty charger bore
A crane in pieces torn, and powdet’d o'er
With salt and flour3 and a white gander’s livet,
Stnfl'd sat with figs, bespoke the curious given
Besides.the wings of hares, for, so it seems,

No man of luxury the back esteemS.

Then saw we black-birds with o’er-roasted breastff
Laid on the heard, and ringdoves rumpless dress !
Delicious fare ! did not our host explain
Their various qualities in endless suain,

Their various natures: but we fled the feast,
Resolv'd in vengeance nothing more to taste‚
As is Canidia, with empoison’d breath‚

Worse than a serpent’5‚ blasted it with death
