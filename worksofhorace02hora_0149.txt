Ems‘rm it.

To ARISTIUS Fuscvs.

To Fuscus, who in city-sports delights.
Χ country-hard with gentle greeting writes ς
ln this we differ, but in allbeside,
Like twin-born brothers, are our souls allied ς

’ And, as a pair os sondly-constant doveS‚

What one dislikes the other disapproves,

You keep the nest, 1 love the rural mead,

T he brook, the mossy took, and woody glade3
In short, 1 live and reign, whene'er Ι fly

The joys you vaunt with rapture to the sky,
And like a slave, from the priest's service fied,

l nauseate honey'd cakes, and long for bread.
Would you to Nature's laws obedient yield3
Would you a house sor health or pleasure bussd,
WVhere is there such a situation found,

Aswhere the country spreads its blessings round .-
'Where is the intemperate winter less severe ἓ
Or, when the sun ascending fires the year,
Where breathes a milder zephyr to assuage
The Dog-star's sury, or the Lion's rago ?

Where do less envious cares disturb our rest ἓ
Or are the fields, in nature's colours drest,

Less grateful to the smell, or to the sight,

'shan the rich floor, with inlaid mat-hle might·-
ise water puter from the bursting lead,
