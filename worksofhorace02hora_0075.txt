SATIRES, BOOK 11.

His cattle graz'd‚ and children listening stood,

The cheerful swain his pleasing tale pursued.

2. On working days I had no idle treat,

But a smok’d leg of pork and greens 1 eat3

Yet when arrived some long-expected guest,

λ Or rainy weather gave an bour os rest,

lfa kind neighbour then a visit pald,

An entertainment more profuse I made 3

'rhough with a kid, or pullet‚ well content,

Ne'er for luxurious fish to Rome Ι sent3

With nuts and figs 1 cro'wn'd the cheerful boam,

'Phe largest that the season could afford.

The socia] glass went round with cheeriulness,

And our sole rule wasto avoid excess.

Our due libations were to Ceres paid‚

To bless our corn, and fill the rising blade,

While the gay wine dispell'd each anxious care.

And smooth'd the wrinkled forehead too severe.
Let F ortune tage, and new disorders make,

From such a life how little can she take!

Or have we liv’d at a more frugal rate

Since this new stranger seized on our estate ,³

Nature will no perpetual heir assign,

Or make the farm his property or mine.

He turn'd us out: but follies all his own,

Or law-suits, and their knaveries unknown,

Or, all his sollies and his law-suits past,

Some long-liv'd heir shall turn him out at last.

The farm, once mine, now bears Umbrenus' name

'rhe use alone, not property we claim :

'l‘hen be not with your present lot deprest‚

And meet the sunu-e with undaumed breast.
