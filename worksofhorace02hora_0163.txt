EPISTLES, BOOK 1. 155,

’ἃ Beauteous Laverna, my petition hear3

Let me with truth and sanctity appear:

Oh ! give me to deceive, and with a veil

Of darkness and of night my crimes conceal.'‘
Behold the miser bending down to earth

For a poor sarthing, which the boys in mirth

-‚ Fix'd to the ground 3 and shall the caitiff dare

In honest freedom with a slave compare?
Whoever wishes is with sear possest,
And he, who holds that passion in his breast,
Is in my sense a slave ς hath left the post
Where virtue plac'd him, and his arms hath lost :
To purchase hasty wealth his soree applies,
And over-whelm'd beneath his burthen lies.
Say, is not this a very worthless knave?
But is you have the most untoward slave,
Yet kill him not, he may some profit yield,
Of strength to guard your flocks, and plough your¹
field,
Or let him winter in the stormy main,
By imports to reduce the price of grain.
The good, and wise, like Bacchus in the play,
Dare, to the king of Thebes, undaunted say,
What can thy power? Thy threateuings 1 disdain.

Pentheus.
l‘ll take away thy goods.
Bacchus,

, Τ Perhaps, you mean
My cattle, money, moveables, or land,
well, take them all.
