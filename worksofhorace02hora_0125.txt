EPISTLE Ι,

ΤΟ MAECENAS.

υ THOU, to whom the Muse first tun’d her lyro.
Whose friendship shall her latest song inspire,
Wherefore‚ Maecenas, would you thus engage
Your hard, dismiss'd with honour from the stage,
Again to venture in the lists of fame,

His youth, his genius, now no more the same ?

Secure in his retreat Vejanius lies,

Hangs up his arms, nor cour-ts the doubtful ptize ·
Wisely resolv'd to tempt his sate no more,
Or the light crowd sor his discharge implore.

The voice of reason eries with piercing force,
Loose from the rapid car your aged horse,

Lest in the race derided, left behind,
Jaded he drags his limbs, and bursts his wind.

Then here sarewell th' amusements of my youth ;
Farewell to verses ; for the search of truth
And moral deceney hath fill’d my breast,
Hath every thought and faculty possest3
And 1 now form my philosophie lore,

For all my future lise a treasur’d stote.
