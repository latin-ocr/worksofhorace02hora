, EPISTLES, BOOK 1. 157

Nor ill he lives, who lives and dies unknown3
But would you serve your friends, and joyous waste
The bounteous honr, perfia me you sor the feast,
“ His patient herhs could Aristippus eat,
He had disdain’d the tables of the great‚”
And he, who censures me, the sage replies,
11 he could live with kings‚ would herbs despise.
Tell me, which likes you best, or, younger, hear(
why Atistippus' maxims best appear3
For with the suatling Cynic well he phy’d,
⁴⁸ 1 am my own buffoon, you take the trade
To please the crota-<13 yet sure 'tis better pride.
Maintain'd by monarche, on my horse toffitle.
But while at court observant I attend,
For things os vileness you submissive bend ·-
Own a superior, and yet proudly vaunt,
Iinperious Cyme, that you nothing waut.”
Yet Aristippus every dress became :
Iu every various change oflise the same3
And though he aim’d at things of higher kind,
Yet to the present held an equal mind.
But that a man, whom patience taught to wear
A thick, coarse coat, should ever leam to beat⁴
A change of life with decency aud ease,
May justly, 1 confess, our wonder raise.
Yet Aristippus, though but meanly drest‚
Nor warns, nor wishes sor, a purple vest3
He walks, regardless os the public gaze,
And knows in every character to please3
But neither dog’s nor snake‘s envenom’d bite
Can, like a silken robe, the Cynic fright.
‘⁶ Give him his manile, or he dies with colel-³⁵
‘⁶ Nay, give it, let the fool his messing hold‚”
