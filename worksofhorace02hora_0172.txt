264 THE woRKs OF Homer

Be sure to catch the flying gale,
Lest adverse winds‚ with rapid force,
Should bear you from your destin‘d course
The grave a gay companion shun3
Far from the sad the jovial run,
The gay, the witty. and sedate,
Are objeots of each other’s hate3
And they, who quaff their midnight glase,
Scorn them who dare their bumper pass,
Although they loudly swear, they dread
A sick debauch, and aching head.
Be every look serenely gay,
And drive all cloudy cares away,
The modest oft too dark appear,
The silent, thoughtsul and severe.
Consult with care the learned page ε
inquire of every scienc'd sage,
How you may glide with gentle ease
Adown the current of your days,
Nor vex’d by mean and low desires,
Nor warm'd by wild ambition's fires,
By hope alarm‘d, depress'd by sear,
For things but little worth your care:
‘Whether fair virtue's hallow'd rules
l‘roceed from Nature, or the schools;
What may the force of care suspend,
And make you to yourself a 'friend ς
Whether the tranquil mind and pure,
Honours, or wealth, our bliss insure,
Or down through lise unknown to stray,
Where lonely leads the silent way.
When happy in my rural scene,
Whose fountain chills the shuddering swain.
