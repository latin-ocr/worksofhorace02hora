THE ART OF POETRY. 209

sud, when no longer licens'd to (lesam,
it sunk to silence with contempt and shame.
No mlh to fame our poets left untried3
Nor small their merit, when with consciens pride
They scorn'd to take from Greece the storied theme,
And dar'd to sing their own domestic same,
lvith Roman heroes fill the tragic scene,
Or sport with humour‘ in *the comio vein.
Nor had the mistress of the world appear'd
More sam'd sor conquest, than for wit rever’d,
Did we not hate the necessary toil
‹xfslow correction. and the painful file.
iilustrious youths, with just contempt receive,
Yoi· let the hardy poem hope to live
Where time und full correction don't refine
'she finish‘d work, and polish every line.
Because Democritus in rapture eries,
‘⁴ Poems of genius always bear the prize
From wretched works of art,” and thinks that none
mut brain-sick barcis can taste os Helioom
Ρη fai· his doctrine o'er the tribe prevails,
Γ hey neithei §have their beatis, nor pare their nails3
''I'o dark retreats and solitude they run,
The baths avoid, and public converse shun3
'she poet's same and fortune sure to gain,
{s long their beardS, incurable theit hrain.
Ah ἔ lncklcss 1! who purge in spring my spicem—
Else sure the first of bards had Horace been.
ssut shall 1 then, in mad put-suit of same,
Resign my reason for a poets name?
No ς let me sharpen others, as the hone
nives edge ιο razors, though itself has none.
