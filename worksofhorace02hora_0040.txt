32 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Cannot in verse and mensures be exprest,
, But may by marks and tokens well be guess'd.

,J Its water, nature’s che pest element,

' Is bought and sold3 its bread most excellent3
Which wary travellers provide with care,
And on their shoulders to Canusium bear,
Whose bread is gritty, and its wealthiest stream
Poor as the town’s of unpoetic name.
Here Varius leaves us, and with *ears he goes:
With equa] tenderness our sorrow flows.
Onward to Rubi wearily we toil’d‚
The journey long, the road with rain was spoil'd.
To Barium, fam’'d for fish we reach'd next day,
The wetaher fairer, but much worse the way.
Then water-curs'd Egnalia gave us joke‚
And laughter great to hear the moon-struck folk
Assem if incense on their alter shy,
Without the help of fire it melts away.
The sons of circumcision may receive
The wondrous tale, which Ι shall ne'er believe3
For I have better learn’d, in blissful ease
That the good gods enjoy immortal days,
Nor anxiously their native skies sorsake,
When miracles the laws of nature break.

From thence our travels to Brundusium bend,

Where our long joumey and my paper end. ·
