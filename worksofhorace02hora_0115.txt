SATIRES, BOOK 11. 107

Is still a slave, a master-slave at best,
So art thou, insolent‚ by me obey'd 3
Thou thing of wood and wires, by others play’d.

Horace.
Who then-is free?

Davus.

The wise, who well maintains
An empire o'er himself 3 whom neither chains,
Nor want, nor death, with slavish sear inspire 3
Who boldly answers to his warm desire 3
'Who can ambition's vainest gists despise3
Firm in himself, who on himself relie33
Polish'd and round who runs his proper course,
And breaks missortune with superiour force.
What is there here, that you can justly claim,
Or call your own? When an imperious dame
Demands her price, with insults vile pursues thee;
Driven out of doors with water well bedews thee,
Then calls you back 3 for shame, shake off her chain,
And boldly tel] her you are free-In vain 3 ’
Α tyrant-lord thy better will restrains‚
And spurs thee hard, and breaks thee to his reins.
If some fam'd piece the painter's art displays‚
Transfix'd you stand, with admiration gaze 3
But is your worship's solly less than mine,
When Ι with wonder view some rude design
In crayons or in charcoal, to invite
The crowd, to see the gladiators fight?
Memmius, in very deed they mount the stage,
And seem in real combat to engage:
Now in strong attitude they dreadful bend3
Wounded they wound 3 they party and defend.-
