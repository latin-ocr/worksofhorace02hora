SATIRES‚ BOOK 11.

He neither stabs his sister, nor his friend3
In a few curse-s his worst passions end ;
He calls her sury, οι· whatever names
. Flow from a breast which cholet high enflames
γ Poor was Opimius, though full rich his chest,
In earthen cups, on some more solemn feast,
Quaff'd the crude juices of a meagre vine,
On week-days dead and vapid was his wine,
When with an heavylethargy opprest‚
His heir in triumph ran from chest to ehest .-
Swist to his aid his faithful doctor flies,
And this expedient to awake him tries 2
From out his bags he pours the shining storo3
And bids a crowd of people count it o’erg
Then plac’d the table near his patient's bed,
And loud, as if he rous'd him from the dead,
‘Aw ake, and guard your wealth3 this momew
wake:
ἲ oux ravening heir will ev ery shilling takest'
What! while Ilive. Ρ “ Thon, wake that you may
live ς
Here take the best prescription Ι can give :
Your bloodless veins, your appetite will fail,
Unless you raise them by a powerful meal.
Take this ptisan—-'’ What will it eost. Ρ N ay hold.
“ Α very ttifle.'’ Sir, I will be told --
“Three peuce. ”-Alas. ' &what does it signisy ‚
Whether by doctors or by thieves l die?

Damasippus.
