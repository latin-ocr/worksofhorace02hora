&nd feel a haughty master's galling weight.
Our fortunas and our shoes are—near allied 3

Pinch’d in the strait, we stumblein the wide.

And on my head, your just rebukesemp10y‚

EPISTLE xl.

To BULLATIUS.

Do the sam’d islands of th' Ionian sens,
Chios, or Lesbos, my Bullatius please?
Or Sardis, where great Croesus held his court ἒ
Say, are they less, or greater, than report?
noes Samos, Colophon, or Smyrna, yield
To our own Tibur, or to Mars's field?
would you, satigu’d with toils os lands and ερας,
In Lebedus, or Asia, spend your days?

You tell me, Lebedus is now become
Adeserr, like our villages at home,
