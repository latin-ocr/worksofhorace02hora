208 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Debase the language, and pollute the scene 3
For what the crowd with lavish rapture praise,
In better judges cold contempt shall raise.

Rome to her poets too much licence gives,
Nor the rough cadence of their verse perceive53
But shall 1 then with careless spirit write?
No--let me think my faults shall rise to light,
And then a kind indulgence wil] excuse
The less importanterrors of the Muse.

Thus, though perhaps Imay not merit same,
,Ι stand secure from censure and from shame.

Make the Greek authors your supreme delight;
Read them by day, and study them by nightss—
“ And yet our sires with joy could Piautus hear3
“ Gay were his jests‚ his numbers charm'd their ear.”
Let me not say too lavishly they prais’d3
But sure their judgment was full cheaply pleas'd‚
If you or Ι, with taste are haply mest,

To know a clownish from a courtly jest3

tf skilful to discern, when form'd with ease

The modulated sounds are taught to please.
Thespis, inventor of the tragic art,

Carried his vagrant players in a cart:

High o'er the crowd the mimic tribe appear’d‚

And play'd and sung, with lees oswine besmear‘d.

Τ hen AEschylus a decent vizard us'd3

ssuilt a low stage 3 the flowing robe diffus’d.

In language more sublime his actm-s rage,

And in the graceful buskin tread the stage.

And now the ancient Comedy appear’d,

Nor without pleasure and applause was heard .·

But soon, its freedom rising to excess,

The laws were forc'd its boldness to suppress‚
