EPISTLE IX.

v 'ro cLAunms NERO.

SEPTIMIUS only knows, at least would seem
To know, the rank 1 hold in your esteem3
Then asks, nay more, compels me to present him

(Nor will a moderate share of praise content him>

Worthy ofNero's family, and beart,
Where only rnen of merit claim a part.
When fondly he persuades himself I hold
A place among your nearer friends enroll'd,
Much better than myself he sees and knows
How far my interest with Tiberius goes.

A thousand things l urg‘d to be excus’d,
T hough seatsu1,iftoo warmly I resus’d,
Ι might, perhaps, a mean dissembler seem,
To make a property os your esteem.
Thus have 1 with a friend's request complicui,
And on the confidence of courts relied :
If you forgive me, to your beart receive
The man Ι love, and know him good and hravt.
