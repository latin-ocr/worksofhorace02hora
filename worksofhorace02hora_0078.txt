70 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Horace.
Spare but this phrensy, use me as you please- -
Damasippus.

Good sir, don't triumph in your o'wn disease.

For all are fools or mad, as well as you,

At least, if what Stertinius says, be true,

Whose wondrous precepts Ι with transport heard,
What time he bade rne nurse this reverend beard,
Cheerful stom the Fabrician bridge depart‚

And with the words os comfort fill’d my beart.

For when, my fortune lost, 'resolv'd I stood,
Covering my head, to plunge into the stood,
Propitious he address’d me—

Sbe'vfitfnius.

. Frienct take heed,
Nor wrong yourself by this unworthy deecl.
“Tis but a vicinus modesty to fear
Among the mad a madmn to appear.
'But listen heedful first, while Ι explain
What madness is, what error of the braim
And‘lf in you alone appear its power,
Then bravely pen-ish : l shall say no more.

Whom vicious follies. or whom falsehood‚ blind,
Are by the Stoics held of madding kind.

All but the wise are oy this process bound,

The subject nations, and the monarch crown'd,
And they who call you f001‚ with equa] claim
May plead an ample title to the name.

When in a wood we leave the certain way
One error fools us, though we various stray:
Some to the left, some turnxto t’other side;

’ So he, who dares thy madness to deride,
