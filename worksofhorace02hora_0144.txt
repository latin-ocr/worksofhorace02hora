136 THE w'oRKs oF nomen

If in this tale th‘ unlueky picture’s mine,
Cheerful the gifts of fortune Ifresigm
Nor, with a load of luxury opprest,
Applaud the sleep that puter meals digest:
Nor would mahange, for blest Arabia's gold,
My native ease, and fieedom uncontrol’d.
You oft have prais’d me, that no bold reque&
A modest poet! on your friends'nip press'd3
My grateful languageever was the same,
1 can’d you every tendet, awful name ς
However, try me, whether I can part
From all your bounty with a cheerrul heart.

The youth, whose sire such various woes had tried,

To Menelaus, not unwise, replied,

“ Our island hath no rich and fertile plain,
No wide-emended course, in which to train
The genereus horse ς then grant me to refuse
A present, that you better know to use.”
For little folks become their little sate,

And, at my age, not Rome's imperial seat,
But soft Tarentum’s more delicious ease,

Or Tibur's solitude‚ my taste can please.

Philip, whose youth was spent in feats of war,
Now grown a famous lawyer at the bar,
Returning from the courts one sultry day,
Complain'd‚ how tedicus was the lengthen'd way
To folks in years3 then wistfully survey’d
A new-trimm⁷d spark, who, joying in the shade,
Loll‘d in a barber's shop, with ease reclin'd,
And par’d his nasss, right indolent os mind.

‘⁶ Demetrius (so was call'd his favourite slave,
For such commissionis a right-trusty knave‚)
