Thau, in proportion to your growing store,
Your lust of lucre is inflam'd the more?

If you were wounded‚ and your wound imbib’d
No soothing ease from roots or herbs prescrib’d,
You would avoid such medicines, be sure,

As roots and herbs, that could effect no cure.

But you have heard, that folly flies apace
From him, whom heaven has gifted with the grace
Os happy wealth3 and though you have aspir'd
Not more to wisdom, since you first acquir'd
A fund, yet will you listen to no rule
But that from Fortune's insufficient school?
Could riches add but prudence to your years,
Restrain your wishes, and abate your fears,

You then might blush with reason, if you knew
One man on earth more covetous than you.

If that be yours, sor which you fairly told

The price concluded (and as lawyers hold,

In some things use a property secures‚)

The land, which feeds you, must of course be
yours.

Your neighbour's bailiff‚ who manures the fields,

And sows the corn which your provision yields‚

Finds in effect. that he is but your slave ε

You give your coin, and in return receive

F owls, eggS, and wine : and thus it will be found,

That you have bought insensibly the ground,

The see of which to purchasers before,

Perhaps, had been two thousand pounds, or mo‘re3

For what avails it in a life well past,

At first to pay the purchase, or at last?

The frugal man, who purchas'd two estates,

Yet buys the pot-herbs, which his worship eats,
