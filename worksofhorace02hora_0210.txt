‚202 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

'Let it in joy assume a vivid air 3
Fierce when in rage ς in seriousness severe :

But, is ill suited to the deep distress

And by the sword alone assert his cause.
With umam'd fury let Medea glow,
And Ino's tears in ceaseless anguish flow.
From realm to realm her griefs let Io bear,
And sad Orestes rave in deep despair: ·-

And form a person yet unknown to fame,
From his first entrance to the closing scene
