SATIRES, BOOK 11 . 9‘553

To stout Coranus, who shall slily smoke
The harpy's aim, and turn it to a joke.
The son-in-law shall gravely give the sire
His witness’d will, and presently desire
‘That he would read it: coyly he complies,
And silent cons it with attentive eyes,
But finds, alas! to him and his forlorn
No legacy bequeath’d—except to meum,
Add to these precepts, ifa crasty lass,
Or freed-man, manage a delirious ass,
Be their ally3 their saith applausi, that you,
When absent, may receive as much in lieu ς
’Tis good to take these out-works to his pelf,
But best to storm the citadel itself.

VVrites he vile verses in a frantie vein?
Augment his madness, aud approve the strain÷
Ptevent his asking, if he loves a wench,

And let your-wife his nobler passions quench.

Ulysses.

Can you suppose, a dame so chaste, so pure,
Could e’er be tempted to the guilty lure,
VVhom all the suitors amorously strove,
In vain, to stagger in her plightcd love?
Tiresias.
The youth too sparing of their preseuts came,-
They lov'd the banquet‚ rather than the dame3 ς
And thus your prudent, honourable sponse, ⁴
lt seems, was faithful to her nuptial vows.
But had she once indulg’d the dotard'sgleo,
Smaek‘d her old cull, and shar'd the spoil with thee.-
She never after could be terrified‚
sagacious beagle, from the reeking hide.
