And the true pickle of Byzantian brine;
Let it with shredded herbs and saffron boil,
And when it cools pour in Venafran ,oiL

Picenian fruits with julcy flavour grew,
But Tibur’s with superiour beauty glow. ἢ
Some grapes have with success in pots been tried -;-
The Alban better in the smoke are dried ς
W ith them and apples ant! the lees of wine,
'White pepper, common salt, and herting-brine,
Ι first invented a delicious feast,
And gave a separate plate to every guest.
'Momm-ons, to spend a fortune on a dish,
Or crowd the table with a load of fish Ξ

It strongly turns the emmach, when a slave
Shall on your cup the greasy tokens leave
Of what rich sance the luscious caitiff stole ;
Or when vile mould incrusts your antique bowl.
Brooms, mats, and saw-dust are so cheaply bought,
That not to have thern is a shameless fault.
What ! sweep with dirty broom a floor inlaid,
Or on foul couches Tyrian carpets spread ἓ

Horace.

Catius, by friendship, by the powers divine,
Take me to hear this learned sage of thine3

‘F or though his rules you faithfully express,

This mere repeating makes the pleasure less.
Resides, what joy to view his air and mien 2
Tfifles to you, because full often seen.

Nor mean that ardour which my breast enflames‚
To visit wisdom’s even remutet streamS,

And by yo med, friendly guidance led,
Quaff thwecept at the fountain-head, ’·“’·ῑ,“’
