EPISTLES, BOOK 1. 165

Such is my prayer—Let me possess
My present wealth‚ or even less,
And if the bounteous gods design

A longer lise, that life be mine.
Give me of books the mental cheer,
Os wealth sufficient for a year,

Nor let me fioat in Fortune's power,
Dependant on the future hour.

To Jove for life and wealth Ι pray‚
These Jove may give, or take away,
But, sor a firm and tranquil mind,
'Phar blessing in myself 1 find.

ΤΟ MAECENAS.

To old ‚Cratinus if you credit give,
No water-drinker's verses long shall live,
Or long shall please. Among his motly fuld,
Satyrs and Fauns, when Bacchus had enroll'd
The hrain-sick mimos, soon the tuneful Nine
At morning breath‘d, and not too sweet‚ of wint·-
When Homer sings the joys oswine, ‘tis plain
Great Homer was not osa sober strain ς
And father Ennius, tiu with drinking fir’d,
VVas never to the martial song inspir'd.
Let thirsty spirits make the bar their choice,
Nor date in eheersul song to raise their voice.
