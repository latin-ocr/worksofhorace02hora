EPISTLE xm.

ΤΟ VINIUS ASELLA.

V INIUS, Ι oft desir'd you, ere you went,
Well seal’d my rhiming volumes to present
WVhen Caesar's high in heahb, in spirits gay,

Or if he ask to read th' unoffer’d lay,

Lest you offend with too officious zeal,

And my poor works his just resentment feels
Throw down the burden‚ is it gall your back,
Nor at the palace fiercely break the pack,
Lest my dear ass become the laughing sport,
The quibbling sable os the-wite at court.

ἢ Through rivers, steeps, and sens, exert your force,
Nor, when you’re victor os the destin'd course,
Under your arm the letter'd bundle bear,

As rustic's do their lambs, with awkward aira
Or Pyrrhia, reeling from the drunken bowl,
conveys away the ball os wool she stole ς
Or, in his pride, a tribe-invited guest
carries his cap and slepers to a feast ;

Nor loud proclam, with how much toil you bear

Such verse, as may detain even Caesar’s ear,
Farewell, make haste ς and special cantion take.
Lest you should stumble, and my orders break.
