190 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Bad poets ever are a standing jest:
But they rejoice‚ and, in their folly blest‚
Admire themselves3 nay, though you silent sit,
They bless themselves in wonder at their wit.
But he who studies masterly to frame
A finish'd picae, and build an honest same,
Acts to himself the friendly critic’s part,
And proves his genius by the rules of art 3
Boldly blots out whatever seems obscure,
Or lightly mean, unworthy to procui-e

With warm reluctance, and by force obey3
Though yet enshrin’d within his desk they stand,
And claim 3 sanction from his parent hand.

As from the treasure osa latent mine,
Long darken'd words he shall with art refine;
Bring into light, to dignify his page,
The nervous language of a former age,
Us’d by the Catoes, and Cethegus old,
Tho' now desonn'd with dust‚ and cover'd o'er with

mould.

New words he shall endenizen, which use
Shall anaim-ise, and currently produce;
Then, brightly smooth‚ and yet sublimely strong,
Like a pure river, through his flowing song
Shall pour the riches of his fancy wide,
And bless his Latium with a vocal tide3
Prune theluxuriant phrase3 the rude refine,
Or blot the languid and unsinew'd line.
Yet hard he labours for this seeming ease ς
As art, not nature, makes our dancers please.
A stu pid scribbler let me rather seem,
While os my faults with dear delight 1 deem,
