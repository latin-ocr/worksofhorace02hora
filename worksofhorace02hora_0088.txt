'50 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

A youth, upon his father's death, receives
A thousand talents, and his orders gives,
That all the trades of elegance and teste,
All who with wit and humour joy a feast,
The impious crowd, that fills the Tuscan street,
Early next morning at his house should meet. ,
vWhat then? they frequent his command obey’d.
And thus his speech the wily l'ander made:
Whate'et these people have: whate'er is mine:¹
Po-day, to-morrow send, be sure is thino.
Hear the just youth this generous answer make :
‘² In clumsy boots, dear humer, for my sake,
'fou sleep in wild Lucania's snowy waste.
'Phat 1 at night on a whole boat may feast.
For fish you boldly sweep the wintry seas,
That Ι, unworthy, may enjoy my ease.
Let each five hundred pounds, with pleasure, take - .
To thee, dear Pandar, 1 a present make
Of twice a thousand, that with all her charms
Your wife at night may run into my arms.'’
An actor’s son dissolv'd a wealthy pearl
(The precious ear-ring of his favourite girl)
{n vinegar, and thus luxurious quaff’d
A thousand solid talents at a draught.
Had he not equally his wisdom shown,
Into the sink or river were it thrown?
A noble pair os brothers, twins, in truth,
In all th' excesses, miles, crimes of youth,
On nightingale's of monstrous purchase din'd ς
What is their process? Are they sound os mind ν
Suppose, in childish architecture skill'd,
A bearded suge his castlezsottage build,
Play odd and even, ride his reedy cane,
