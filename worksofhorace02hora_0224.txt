„2115 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

But, heedless wandering‚ if our man of rhime.
Bursting with verses of the true sublime,

Like fowler, earnest at his gaure, should fall
Into a weil or ditch, and loudly call,

“ Good fellow-citizens and neighbours dear,
Help a poor bard”—-not one of them will hear ;
Or if, perchance, a saving rope they throw‚

I will be there, and—‘⁶ Sirs, you do not know

Content to be a man ς nor will his pride

Lay such a glorious love of death aside.

Nor is it plain for what more horrid crime

Or hallow'd ground with sacrilege profan'd ε
Certaiu he's mad, and like a baited bear,

Ι f he hath strength enough his den to tear,
With all the hon-ors osa desperate Muse

The learned and unlearned he pursues.

But if he seize you, then the toi-ture dread ς
He fastens ou you, till he rea‘d you dead,
And like a leech, voracious of his foed,

Quits not his cruel hold till gorg'd with blood,
