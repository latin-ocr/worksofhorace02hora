246 THE WORKS OF HORACE. . Ἰ

Why shadows darken the pale queen of night;
whence she renews her orb, and spreads her light
What nature' s jarring sympathy can mean, i
And who, among the wise, their systems best mainz ‘³
tain-
But whether s1aughter' d onions crown your board
Or murder' d fish an impious feast afford,
Receiv e Pompeius Grosphus to your boam
And, ere he asks, your willing aid impart3
He ne'er shall make a bold, unjust request,
And friends are cheap, when good men are distrest
Now condescend to hear the public news :
Agrippa's war the sons of Spain subdues.
The fierce Armenian Nero’s virtue feels:
short by the knees the haughty Parthian kneels:
Again the monarch is by Caesar crown'd,
And Plenty pours her golden harvest round.
