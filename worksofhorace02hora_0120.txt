112 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

With dust, how black Ξ not such the clouds arise
When o’er the plain a northern tempest flies,
Some hon-ors, yet more horrible, we dread,
But raise us, when we found the danger fied.

Poor Rufus droop'd his head, and sadly cried,
As if his only son untimely died.
Sure he had wept, till weeping ne'er had end,
But wise Nomentane thus up-rais'd his friend ε
¹⁴ Fortune, thou cruelest of powers divine,
To joke poor mortals is a joke of thine.”
While Varius with a napkin scarce suppress'd
His laughter, Balatro, who loves 'a jest,
Cries, Such the lot of 1ife; nor must you claim,
For all your tons, a fair return of fame.
While you are tortur'd thus, and torn with pain,
A guest like me, polite, to entertain ,
With bread well hak’d, with sauces season'd right,
And all your slaves most elegantly dight,
Down falls the canopy, a trick of fate,
Or a groom-foonnan stumbling breaks a plate.
Good fortune hides, adversity calls forth,
A landlord's genius, and a general's worth.

To this mine host: ‘⁸ Thou ever-gentle guest,
May all thy wishes by the gods be blest‚
Thou best good man’'—-But when we saw him rise,
From bed to bed the spreading whisper flies.

Horace.

Suro, never play so fine. But, prsthee, say,
How afterwards you laugh’d the time away.

Fundanius.

slaves, eries Vibidius, have you broke the cask?
How often must 1 call sor t’other flask?
