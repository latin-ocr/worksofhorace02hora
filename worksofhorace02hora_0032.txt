524 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Now hear this short defence. For my own part,
Iolaim no portion os the poet's art.
’'ris not enough to close the flowing line,
And in ten syllables your sense confine,
Or write in mere prosaie rhymes like me,
'rhat can deserve the name of poetry.

Is there a man, whom real genius fires,
Whom the diviner soul of verse inspIre53
Who talks true greatne553 let him boldly claim
The sacred honours osa poet’s name.

Some therefore ask, Can comedybe thought
A real poem, since it may be wrought
In style and subject without fire or force,
And,· bate the numbers, is but mere discourse?
‘⁴ But yet in passion’d tone the sire can chide
His spendthrift son⁷ who spurns the portiou’d bride,
And keeps a common weuch, or deep in drink
Reels in fair day-light (shameful) with his link.”
Yet coul'd Pomponius stom his father hear,
Were he alive, a lecture less severe?

'Tis not enough your language to refine,
When, if you break the mensures of the Une,
In common life an angry father’s rage
Is but the same as Demea's on the stage.

T ake from Lucilius’ verse5‚ or from mine,
The cadences, and measures os the line,
Then change their order, ancl the words transpose,
No more the scatter‘d poet's limbs it shows3
Not so-—When hideous Discord bursts the bars,
And iton gates, to pour forth al] her wars.

of this enough ς some future work shall show,
whether tis real poetry, or no.
