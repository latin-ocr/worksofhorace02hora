176 THE WORKS OF HORACE. .

ΤΗΙ the throng'd play-house crack with the dull
» load.

Α These are esteem'd the glories of the stage,

From the first drama to the present age.’'
Sometimes the crowd ¹a proper judgment makes,
But oft they labour under gross mistakes‚
As when their ancients lavishly they raise
Above all modern rivalship of praise.
But that sometimes their style uncouth appears.
Or their harsh numbers rudely hurt our ears,
Or that full flatly flows the languid line-
He, who owns this, hath J ove's assent and minc-
Think not Ι mean, in vengeance, to destroy

The works, for which I smarted when a boy.
But when as perfect models they are prais'd,
Correct and chaste, I own Ι stand amaz'd.
Then if some better phrase, or 'nappier line.
'With suddenllustre unexpected shine,
However harsh the rugged numbers roll,
It stamps a price and merit on the whole.

e Ι feel my honest indignation rise,
When, with affected air, a coxcomb cries,.

 

The work, I own, has elegance and ease,

But sure no modern should presume to please .

Then for his favourite ancients dares to claim

Not pardon only, but rewards and same.

When flowers o'erspread the stage, and sweets⁴
perfume

The crowded theatre, should I presumo

The just suo-cess of Atta's plays to blame„

The senate would pronounce me lost to shamc.

What! criticise the soenes that charm'd the age
; When AEsop and when Roscius trod the stage?
