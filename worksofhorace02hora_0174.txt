166 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Soon as I spoke, our bards, before they write,
Smell os their wine all day, and tipple all the niglu
What ! if with naked feet and savage air,

Cato's short coat some mimic coxcomb wear,
Say, shall his habit and affected gloom
Great Cato's manners, or his worth, assume ?

Cordus, the Moor, while studious how to pleage v

With well-bred raillery, and learned ease,

To rival gay Timagenes he tried,

Yet burst with disappointed spleen and pride :

By such examples many a coxcomb's caught, “

Whose art can only imitate a fault. ’ἢν
Should Ι by chance grow pale, our bardlings think„

That bloodless cumin's the true rhiming drink.

Ye wretched mimics‚ whose fond hearts have been,

How ost Ξ the objects os my mirth and spleen.

’I'hrough open worlds of rhime l dar'd totread

[n paths unknown, by no bold footsteps led ε

Who on himself relies with conscious pride,

-Most certainly the buzzing hive shall guide.

To keen iambicsI first tun’d the lyre,

And warm'd with great Archilochus's fire·

His rapid numbers chose, but shunn'c'i with care ἰ

Τ he style that drove Lycambes to despair. ¹

Ι feax'd to change the structure of his line,

But shall a short-liv'd wreath be therefore mine ,³¹
Sappho, whose verse with manly spirit glows,
Even great Alcaeus his iamb'zcs chose,

In different stanzas though he forms his lines,
And to a theme more merciful inclines;

No perjur‘d sire with blood-stain’d verse pursues3
Nor ties, in damning rhyme, his fair-one‘s noosez
1 first attempted in the Lyric tone
