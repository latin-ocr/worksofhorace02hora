102 THE WORKS OF HORACE-

The dazzled eye. To lure the taste,
The fragments of a costly feast,
Remaining, drest but yesterday,
In baskets, pil’d on baskets, lay.
The courtier nn a purple seat
Had plac’d his rustic friend in state,
Then bustled‚ like a busy host,
Supplying dishes boil'd and roast,
Nor yet omits the courtier's duty
Os tasting, ere he brings the booty.
The country-mou se, with rapture strange,
Rejoices in his fair exchange‚
And lolling, like an easy guest,
Enjoys the cheer, and cracks his jest—
VVhen, on a sudden, opening gates,
Loud-jarring‚ shook them from their seats.
They ran, affrighted‚ through the room,
And, apprehensive of their duom, ⁴
Now trembled more and more; when, hark !
The mastiff-dogs begin to bark ;
The dome, to raise the tumult more,
Resounded to the surly roar.
The bumkin then concludes, Adieu !
This life, perhaps, agrees with you:
My grove, and cave, secure from suares,
shall comfort me with chaff and tates.
