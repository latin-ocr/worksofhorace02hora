22 THE WoRKs OF HORACE..

Drag him to justice, he's a bird, tree, stone,

And laughs as if his cheeks were not his own.
Isbad economists are held unwise‚

In good economy some wxsdom lies,

And then Perillius is ostainted braio,

Who takes your bond to sue for it in vain.

Come all, whose breasts with bad ambition risve,

Or the pale passion, that for money dies,

With luxury, or superstition's gloom,

Whate'er disease your health of mind consume,

Compose your robes ς in decent'ranks draw near,

And, that ye all are mad, with reverence hear.
Misers make whole Anticyra their own :

Its hellebore reserv 'd for thern alone

Staberius thus compell’d his heirs t’ engrave

On his proud tomb what‘flegacies he gave,

Or stand condemn' d togive the crowd a feast,

By Arrius form' d m elegance of taste‚

And gladiators‚ even an hundred pair,

With all the corn of Afric's fruitfu] year.

Such is my will, and whether fool or wise,

1 seorn your censures, the testator eries,

’ Wisely perceiving-

Damasippus..

What could he peteme,

, T hus on his tomb his fortune to engrave Ρ ·

Stertinius.

· Long as he liv'd helook'd on poverty‚

And shunn'd it as acrime of blackest dle ς
And had he died one sarthing less in pelf,

Had seem‘d a worthless villain to himself ς

For virtue, glory, beauty, all divine

And human powers, immortal gold Ξ are thine ;
