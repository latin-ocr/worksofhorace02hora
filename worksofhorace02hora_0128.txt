126 THE woRKs oF HoRAcE.

Be this thy brazen bulwark of desence, ’
Stin to preserve thy conscious innocence,

Nor e'er turn pale with guilt. But, prithee, tell,
shall Otho’s law the children's song excel?
The sons os ancient Rome first sung the strain,

‘That bids the wise, the brave, the virtuous reign.

Α My friend, get money, get a large estate,

By honest means3 but get, at any rate,

That you with knights and senators may sit,
And view the weeping soenes that Pupius writ.
But is he not a friend ofnobler kind,

Who wisely fashions and informs thy mind,
To answer, with a soul erect and brave,

To Fortune's pride, and scorn to be her slave ἓ

But should the people ask me, while Ichoose
γ The public converse, wherefore 1 refuse
To join the public judgment, and approve,

Or fly whatever they dislike. or love ς ⁴
Mine be the an'swer prudent Reynard made
To the sick lion—Truly I'm afraid,

When I behold the steps, that to thy den
Look forward all, but none return again.

But what amany-headed beast is Rome 3
For what opinion shall Ι choose, or whom?
Some joy the public revenues to farm ; ι
By presents some our greedy widows charm 3
Others their nets sor dying dotards lay,

‚And make the childless bacheler their prey ς

By dark extortion some their fortunes raise :
Thus everyman some different passions sways;
For where is he, who can with steady view
Even for an honr his favourite scheme pursuea?
