536 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

If none with avarice justly brand my fame,

With sordidness, or deeds too vile to name:

If pure and innocent: ifdear (forgive

These little praises) to my friends I live,

My father was the cause, who, though maintain'd.

By a lean farm but poorly, yet disdain'd

The country scliuulniaster, to whose low care

The mighty captain sent his high-born heir,

With satchel‚ copy-book, and pelf to pay

The wretched teacher on th’ appointed day.
To Rome by this bold father was Ι brought,

To leam those arts which well-born youth are taught.

So drest and so amended, you would swear

I was some senator's expensive heir:

Himself my guardian, of unblemish'd truth,

Among my tutors would attend my youth,

And thus preserv'd my chastity of mind

(That prime of virtue in its highest kind)

Not only pure from guilt, but ev‘n the shame

That might with vile suspicion hurt my fame;

Nor fear’d to be reproach’d, although my fate

should fix my fortune in some meaner state,

From which some trivial perquisites arise,

Or make me, like himself, collector of excise.
For this my beart, far from complaining, pays

A larger debt of gratitude and praise;

Nor, while my senses hold, shall I repent

Of such a father, nor with pride resent‚

As many do, th’ involuntary disgrace‚

Not to be born of an illustrious race.

But not with their-s my sentiments agree,

Or language3 for, it nature should decree,
