262 THE WORKS oF HoRAcE‚

Nor to your own too earnest bend3
Nor idly court the froward Muse,
While he the vigourous chase pursues,
Humours like these could fatal prove
T 0 Zethus' and Amphion's love,
Until Amphion kind complied‚

And laid th’ offensive lyre aside.

So to your patron's will give way,
His gentle insolenee obey3

And when he pours into the plain
His horses, hounds. and hunting-train‚
Break from the peevish Muse away,
Divide the toils‚ and share the prey.

The chase was by our sires esteem'd.
Healthful, and honourable deem'd.
Thy swiftness far the hound’s exceeds;
'rhe boar beneath thy javelin bleeds3
And who, like thee, with grace can wielsae
The weapons of the martial field,

Or with such loud applause as thine-
Amidst the youhtful battle shine?

In the destructive war of Spain
Early you made your first campaign.
Bene'ath a leader, who regains
Our eagles from the Parthian sanes, ,
Who boundless now extends his sway,
And bids a willing world obey.

Lollius, though all your actions riso
From judgment temperate and wise‚
Yet oft at home you can unbend,

And even to trifling sports descend.
Your little boats, with mimic tage,
Like Actium’s mighty fleets engage ;
