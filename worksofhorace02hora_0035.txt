SATIRES, BOOK Ι. 2?

To caution youth froin squandering their estatc.'’
To sright me from the harlot’s vagrant bed,

‘⁴ Behold Scetauius, and his ruin dread :''

'rhat 1 might ne'er pursue the wedded dame,

‘⁴ Α lawful Venus will indulge your flame.

My son, by poor Trebonius be advis'd;

Sum, ’tis no pleasant tale to be surpris’d.”

“ ’Twixt right and wrong the learned may decide,
With wise distinctions may your conduct guide ς
Be mine the common wisdom, that inspires
The frugal manners of our ancient sires,

And, while your youth may yet a tutor claim,

. To guard your virtue, and preserve your same3

But soon as time confirms, with stronger tone,

Your strength and mind, your conduct be your own.’'··

Thus did he form my youth with lenient hand,
When he for virtue urg'd the soft command,
Pointing some awful senator to view,

Would he dissuade ine? ‘⁴ Can you doubt,‘' he eries,
“ That equal ruin aud dishonour rise

From such an action, when that scoundrel's name
Is branded with the flagrant marks of shame ?”

A neighbour's funeral, with dire affright,

Checks the sick man's intemperate appetite3

So is the shame of others oft imprest

With wholesome terrors on the youthful breast.

Thus, pure from more pernicious crimes I live ·
Some venial frailties you may well forgive,

For such 1 own I have3 and yet ¹even these,
A length of time, although by slow degrees‚
A friend, whose candour freely may reprove.
Or my own reason, shall perhaps remove 3
