ΕΡιεΤιΕε, BooK n. 12⁸2<

l'hough he thinks not: this tyrant of the soil
l3nys the mere wood, which makes his kettle boil.¹
And yet he calls that length of land his own,
From which the poplar, fix'd to limits known,
Cuts off disputes, as if he had the power

ssy favour, purchase‚ force, or fate’s commanda
May change its lord‚ and fall to other hands.
Since thus no mortal property can have

Attends our stam, and o'er our lives presides3
VVhose power appears, propitious, or malign,
Stamp'd on each sace, and varied through each line.
Be mine, my little fortune to enjoy;
ἅ moderate pittance on myself employ‚
