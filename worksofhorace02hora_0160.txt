ΤΟ ΩΠΙΝὓΤῙΠῧι

ASK not, good Quinctius, if my farm maintaie
its wealthy master with abundant grain,
With fruits or pastures ς ask not, if the vine
Around its bridegroom-elm luxuriant mine,
For 1⁹11 describe, and in loquacious stmitg,
The site and figure of the pleasing scene. ,

Α chain ofmountains with a vale divide,
That opens to the sun on either side :
‘Phe right wide spreading to the rising day,
The left is warm’d beneath his setting ray.
How mild the clime. where sloes luxurious grou .,
And blushing cornels on the bawthorn glow !
My cattle are with plenteous aconis sed,
‘Whose various oaks around theis master spreta&
Well might you swear, that here Tarentum waws
Its dusky shade‚ and pours forth all its leaves.
