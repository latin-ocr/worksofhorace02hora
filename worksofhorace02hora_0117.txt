HORACE . FUNDANIUS.

Horace.

THEY told me, that you spent the jovial night
With Nasidienus, that same happy wight,
From early day, or you had been my guest 3
But, prhhee, tell me how you lik’d your feast.

Sure never better.

Around him lay whatever could excite,

With pungent force, the jaded appetite ;

Rapes, lettuce‚ radishes, anchovy-brine,

With skerrets, and the lees 01 Coan wine÷
