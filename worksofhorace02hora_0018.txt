10 THE WORKS OF HORAcss.

Horace.

Why will you pretend,
With such extremes, your conduct to defend?
The sordid miser when Ι justly blame,
1 would not have you prodigal of fame,
Sprendthrift or rake; sor sure some difference lies
Between the very fool and very wise ς
‘Some certain mean in all things may be found,
To mark our virtues.. and our vices bound.
But to return from whence we heve digress'd:
And is the miser, then, alone unblest ?
Does he alone applaud his neighbour's sate,
Or plne with envy of his happier state?
To crowds beneath him never turn his eye,
Whete in distress the sons os virtue lie,
But, to outspeed the wealthv‚ bend his force,
As if they stopp'd his own impetuous course?
Thus, from the goa} when swift the chariot flies3,
The eharioteer the bending la sh applies,
To overtake the foremost on the plain, ο
But looks on all behind him with disdain.
From hence, how few, like sated guests‚ depart
From lise’s sul] banquet with a cheerful heart i
But let me stop, lest you suspect ἶ stole
From blind Crispinus this eterna] scroll.
