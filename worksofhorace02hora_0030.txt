SATIRE IV.

THE comio poets. in its earliest age
Who sorm’djhe manners os the Grecian stage,
Was there a villain, who might justly claim
A better right of being damn’d to fame,

Rake, cut-throat‚ thies, whatever was his crime,
They freely stigmatis’d vhe wretch in rhyme.

From their example whole Lucilius rose,
Though different measures. different verse he chose.
He rallied with a gay and eas}⁷ air.

But rude his numbers, and his style severe.
He weakly fancied it a glorious seat

His hundred lines extempore to rapeat,

And as his verses like a torrent roll,

The stream runs muddy. and the water's foul.
He prattled rhymes ι but lazy and unfit

For writing well ; for much. l own. he writ.
