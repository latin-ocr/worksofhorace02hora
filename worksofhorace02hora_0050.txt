4²2 THE WORKS oF HORAOE}

But, oh! nor thies, nor savage beast‚
That us'd these gardens to infest,
E'er gave me half such care and pains
As they, who turn poor people's hrains
With venom’d drugs and magio lay—
These I can never fright away;
For when the beauteous queen of night
Up-lifts her head adom'd with light,
Hither they come, pernicious crones Ξ
To gather poisonous herbs and bone s.
Canidia with dishevel'd hair
(Black was her robe, her feet were bate]
With Sagana, infernal dame !
Her elder sister, hither came.
With yellings dire they fill‘d the place,
And hideous pale was either's face.
Soon with their nails they scrap‘d the ground,
And fill'd a magio trench profound
With a black lamb's thick-streaming gore,
whose members with their teeth they tore,
That they may charin the sprites to tell
Some curious anecdotos from hell.
The beldams then two figures brought3
Of wool and wax the forms were wrought ;
The woollen was erect and tall,
And scourg'd the waxen image small,
Which in a suppliant, servile mood
With dying air just gasping stood.
On Hecate one beldam calls;
The other to the Furies bawls‚
While serpente crawl along the ground.
And hell-born bitohes howl around.
