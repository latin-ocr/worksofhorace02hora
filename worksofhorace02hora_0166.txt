15& THE WORKS OF HORACE.

In glorious war a triumph to obtain,
Celestial honours, and a seut shall gain
Fast by the throne of J ove3 nor mean the praise
These deities of human kind to please.

‘⁶ But, midst the storms and tempests osa court,
Not every one shall reach the wish'd-for port3 ,
And sure the man, who doubts of his success, -
Wisely declines th' attempt''—Then you oonfess, ⁴
That who succeeds, thus difficult his part,

Gives the best proof of courage, as of art.
Then, here, orno where, we the truth shall find ς
Conscious how weak in body, or in mind,
When we behold the burthen with despair,
Which others boldly try, with spirit bear,

1f virtue's aught beyond an empty name,
Rewards and honours they with justice claim„

In silence who their poverty conceal,

More than th’ importunate, with kings prevail:
And whether we with modest actio'n take,
Or snatch the favour, may some difference make-2

From this fair fountain our best profits rise:
For, when with plaintive tone a suppliant eries,
My sister lies unportion’d on my hands ;

My mother's poor, nor can Isell my lands,

Or they maintain me3 might he not have said,
Give me, ah Ξ give me, sir, my claily bread?
While he, who hears him, chants on t' other side,
With me your bounty‚ ah Ξ with me divides

But had the crow his food in silence eat,

Less had his quarrels been, and more his meat,

A jaunt os pleasure should my lord intend,
And with him deign to take an humble frienQ
To talk os broken reads, of cold and rain, ’ ·
