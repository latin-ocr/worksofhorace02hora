Since nor the various luxuries of fish,

’ Nor foreign wild-fowl can delight the pale,
fSurseit-owoln guest ς yet l shall ne’er pwpvail'

And-the gay peacock with its train resuse 3⁶* '¹
fol-‘ibe rare bird at migbty price is sold. ¹
„And lo! what wonders from its tail unfold!

’ But can these whims a higher gusto mise,

Unless you eat the plumage that you praise?

Or do iis 'glories when 'tis boss'd, remain ?

No; ’tis ,ω’ unequall’d beauty of its train
Deludes youreye, aqtj <gb-arms you to the feast,
For hens and peacocks sii-e alikc in taste.

But say, by what diseernment are you taught
To know, that this voracious pike was caught « q
Where the ἷιιῌ river’s lenient watets glide,

Or where the'gbridges break the rapit] tide :
In the mig, ocean, or where Tiber pays

’ With broesder course his tribute to the seas?

Madly you praise the mullet's three pound weigxn,
And yet yon stew it pieac-meal ere you eat;
Your eye deceives you ς wherefore else dislikc

The natural greatness osasull grown pike,

Yet in a. mullet so much joy express ἒ

“ Pikes are by nature large, and mullets legs?
Give me, the harpy-throated glutton criels,

In a large dish a munet's largest size: Ψ

· Βεεβέῇᾶ, ye southern winds, propitious haste,

Ancfdress his damties for this man ostaste.
And yet it needs not: sor when such excess
Shall his 0'er-jaded appetite oppreSS‚ '
The new-caught turbot's tainted-ere he eat,
A nd biner herbs are a deliniens (reat.
