38 ΤΗΕ ἏΤΟΒΚΒ OF HORACE.

Two goblets, and a ewer to wash my hand53
An hallow'd cup of true Campanian clay,
My pure libations to the gods to pay.
I then retire to rest, nor anxious [bar
Before dread Marsyas early to appear,
whose very statue swears it cannot brook
The meanness of that slave-bom judge’s look.
1 sleep till ten; then take a walk, or choose
A book, perhaps, or trifle with the Muse3
For cheerful exercise and manly toil
Anoint my body with a pliant eil,
But not with such as Natta’s‚ when he vamps
His filthy limbs, and robs the public lamps.

But when the sun pours down his fieroer fite,
And bids me frpm the toilsome sport retire,
I haste to1bathe, then decently regale
My eraving stomach with a frugal umal,
Enough to nourish nature for a day,
Then trifle my domestic hours away.

Such is the life from bad ambition free;
Such comfort has the man low-born like me ς
With which I feel myself more truly mest,

'I'han if my sires the quaestor’s power possess’e't.
