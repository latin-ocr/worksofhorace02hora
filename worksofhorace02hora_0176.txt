ωε THE WORKS OF HoRACE-

EPISTLE XX.

To HIS BOOK.

THE shops of Rome impatient to behold,
And, elegantly polish'd, to be sold,
'You hate the tendet seal, and guardian keys,
Which modest volumes love, and fondly praise
'she public world, even sighing to be read,—
Unhappy book! to other manners bred.
Indulge the fond desire, with which you burn,
Pursue your ssight, yet think not to return.—

But, when insulted by the critic‘s scnrn,
How often shall you cry, Ah! me sorlorn 2
When he shall throw the tedicus volume by,
Nor longer view thee with a lover's eye.

If tage mislead not my phophetic truth,

Rome shall admire, while you can charm with youth:

But soon as vulgar hands thy beauty soil,
The moth shall hatten on the silent spoil,
To Afric sent, or packeted to Spain,
Our colonies of wits to entertain.
This shall thy fond adviser laughing see,
As, when his ass was obstinate like thee,
The clown in vengeance push'd him down the hill:
For who would save an ass against his will ἓ
At last thy stammering age in suburb schools
Shall toil in teaching boys their grammar-mles ς
