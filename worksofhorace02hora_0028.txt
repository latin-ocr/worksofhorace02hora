20 · THE WORKS OF HORACE.

A ffiend has soul⁷d my conch : ab! deep disgracef
Or off the table thrown some high—wrought vase,
Or, hungry, snatch'd a chicken off my plate,

Shall Ι for this a good companion hate‘?
What 1f he robb'd me, or his trust betray'd,
Or broke the sacred promise he had made?
who hold all crimes alxke are deep distrest,
When we appeal to Truth’s impartial test.
Sense, custom, socia} good, from whence arise
AlNoms of right and wrong, the fact denies.

'When the first mortals crawling rose to birth,
Speechless and wretched. from their mother—earth,
For caves and acorns, then the fond of lise, Ι
’ With nails and fists they held a bloodless strife3
But soon improv'd‚ w³th clubs they bolder fought,

- And· various arms, which sad experience wrought,

Tin words, to fix the wandering voice, were found,
And names impress’d a neaning upon sound.
Thenceforth they cease from war3 their towns ene
close

With formidable walls. and laws compose
To strike the thies and highwayman with dread,
And vindicate the sacred marriage· bed.
For woman, long ere Helen's fatal charms,
Destructive woman ἔ set the world in arms :
But the first heroes died unknown to fame,
Like beasts v‘vho ravish’d the uncertain dame ;
When, as the stoutest bun commannis the rest,
The weaker by the stronger was opprest.

Turn o’er the world’s great annals. and you find,
That laws were first invented by mankind
To stop oppression's rage. For tffiugh we leam, μ
By nature, good from evil to discern3
