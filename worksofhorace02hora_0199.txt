EPISTLES, BOOK 11. 191

Or not perceive, than sing no morta] strain,
And bear this teil, this torture os the hrain.
At Argos liv‘d a citizen, well known,
who long imagin'd that he heard the tone
Of deep tragedians on an empty stage,
And sat applauding in ecstatic tage ι
In other points, a person who maintain'd
A due decorum, and a lise unstain’d‚
Α worthy neighbour, and a friend sincere,
Kind to his wife, nor to his slaves severe,
Nor prono to madness, though the selon's sork
Desac'd the signet osa battle-eorm
And wise to §hun (well knowing which was which³
The tock high pendent, and the yawning ditch.
He, when his friends, at much expense and pains,
Had amply purg’d with hellebore his hrains,
Come to himself—‘⁴ Ah ! cruel friends !‘’ he cried‚
‘⁶ Is this to save me? Better far have died,
Than thus be robb’d of pleasure so refin’d,
The dear delusion osa raptur'd mind.”
’Tis wisdom’s part to bid adieu to toys,
And yield amusements to the taste os boys,
Not the soft sound of empty words admire,
Or model measures to the Roman lym,
But leam such strains and rhapsodies, as roll
Tuneful through lise, and harmonise the soul-
Thus, when alone, I commune with my heart,
And silent meditate this nobler art3
1 f no repletion from the limpid stream
Allay'd the bumings os your thitsty flame,
You sttaight w‘Quld tell the doctor your distress,
A nd is there none to whom you dare consess,
