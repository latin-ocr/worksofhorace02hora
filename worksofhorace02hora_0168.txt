,260 THE WORKS OF HoRAcE.

Rustic, inelegant, uncouth,
With shaggy beard and nasty tooth,
That fondly would be thought to be
F air virtue, and pure liberty ς
But virtue in a medium lies,
From whence these different sollies rism
Another, with devotion fervent,
Is more than your obsequious servant ς
Admitted as an humble guest,
VVhere men of money break their jest‚
He waits the nod, with awe prosound‚
And catches, ere it reach the ground,
The falling joke, and echoes back the sound.
A school-boy thus, with humble air,
Repeats to pedagogue severe;
Thus players act an under-part,
And sear to put forth all their art.
Another in disputo engages,
With-nonsense axm’d sor nothing tage&
“ My word of honour not believ'd?
Or my opinion not receiv'd ?
And shall Ι, whether right or wrong,
Be forc'd‚ forsooth, to hold my tongue s?
'No—at a price so base and mean,
1 would a thousand lives disdain.”
But what's the cause-os all this tage?
VVho's the best actor on the stage.
01· to which road you best may tum γε,
Isto Brundusium lies your joumey.
Now, Lollius, mark the wretch’s sate.
Who lives dependant on the great.

tf Venus be his=darling vice3
