Then‚ lest repentanee punish such a life,
Never, ah Ξ never kiss your neighbour's wife3
For see, what thousand mischiefs round you* fise,
And few the pleasures, though you gain the prize.
What though Cerinthus dotes upon the girl,

The flowing robe, and closely muffled vell
With envious folds the precious thing coneeaJ3
But what from nature's eqmmoners you buy,
