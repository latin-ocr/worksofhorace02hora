SATIRES, BOOK 1. 33

‚SATJRE vl.

ΤΟ MAECENAS.

THOUGH, since the Lydians fill'd the Tuscah
coasts,
No richer blood than yours Etruria boast53
Though your great ancestors have armies led,
You don‘t‚ as many do, with scorn upbraid
Theman of birth unknown, or turn the nose
On me, who from a race of slaves arose :
While you regard not, from what low degree
A man’s descended, if his mind be free ς
Convinc'd‚ that long before th' ignoble reign
And power of Tullius, from a servile strain
Fun many rose for virtue high renown’d,
By worth ennobled‚ and with honours crown'd.
While he who boasts that ancient race his own,
Which drove the haughty Tarquin from the throne,
[s vile and worthless in the people’s eyes:
The people‚ who, you know, bestow the prize
To men most worthless‚ and, like slaves to same,
With soolish reverence hail a titled name,
And, rapt, with aive-struck admiration gaze
When the long race its images displays.
But how shall we, who differ far and wide
From the mere vulgar, this great point decide?
For grannthe crowd some higinbirth'd scoundrel chuse.

And to the low-bom man of worth refuso
