EPISTLE V.
To TORQUATUS.-

ff, my Torquatus, you can kindly deign„

To lie on beds of simple form and plain,

And sup on herbs alone, but richly west,

At evening Ι expect you for my guest.

Nor old, 1 own, nor excellent my wine,

Os five years vintage, and a marshy vine,

If you have better, bring th’ enlivening chem,

Or, from an humble friend, this summons bear,-

Iu hopes my honour’d guest to entertain‚

My fires are lighted, my apartments clean3

Then leave the hope, that, wing’d with folly, flies ς-
Leave the mean quarrels, that from wealth arise3
Leave the litigious bar, for Caesar’s birth

Proclaims the festal hour of ease and mirth,

While social converse, till the rising light,

Shau streletz, beyond its length, the summer’s night,
Say, what are fortune's gists‚ if l’m denied
'rheircheerful use? for neaxly are auied
