2⁴4 THE WORKS OF HORACEV

ΡΠ tell a tale, well worthy to be 'told‚

A fact that happen'd, and l then was old}

An hag at Thebes, a wicked one no doubt,

Was thus, according to her will, lugg'd qut,

Stiff to the pile. Upon his naked back ἕ ,

Her heir sustain'd the well-anointed pack.

She, likely, took this crotchet in her head,

That she might slip, is possible. when dead,

From him, who, trudging through a filthy road, .
Had stuck too closely to the living load.

Be cautious therefore, and advance with art,

Nor sink beneath. nor over-act your part.

Α noisy fellow mu st ofeou rse offend

The surly temper of a sullen friend:

Yet be not mute—like Davus in the play

'With head inclinffp5 his awful nod obey,

Creep into favour': isa ruder gale

Assault his face, admonish him to veil

His precious pate. Oppose your shoulders, prout]
To disengage hini from the bustling crowd.

Is he loves prassng, hang an ear: should lust

of empty glory be the blockhead's gust,

Indulge his eager appetite, and puff

Tha growing bladder with inspiring stuff,

‘rin he, with hands uplisted to the skies,
,Enoughl enough! in glutted rapture eries. , ,
ν When he shall free you from your servile sear. 7
And tedious tolli when broad awake‚ you hear:
‘⁴ To good Ulysses‚ my right trusty slavo,
,Α fourth division of my lands Ι leave :”

Is then (as void of consolation, roar)

My dearest friend, my Dama now no more?
