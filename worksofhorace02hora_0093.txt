SATIRE lv.

HORACE, cATan.

Horace.

WHENCE comes my Cadus? whither in sucu
haste ?

Catius.

I have no time in idle prate to waste.
1 must away to treasure in my mind
A set of precepts‚ novel and refined 3
Such as Pythagoras could never mach,
Nor Socrates nor scienc'd Plato teach.

Horace.

1 ask your panion, and confess my crime,

To interrupt you at so cross a time.

But yet, if aught escap'd through strange neglect,
You shall with ease the wisdom recollect,
whether you boast, from nature or from art,
This wondrous gift of holding things by heart.

Catius.

1 meant to store them total in my head,
The matter nice, and wrought of subtle thread.

Horace.

But prithee‚ Catius, what's your sage’s name P
Is he a Roman, or of foreign same?
