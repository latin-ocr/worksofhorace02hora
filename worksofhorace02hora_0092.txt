84 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

And only ⁴one escap'd, who thus express’d

The doleful news—‘⁴ Ah me! a monstrous beast
My brothers hath destroy'd.” How large? she cries-
And swelling forth—was this the monstess’s size? ¹
Then larger grows—What! is he larger still ?
When more and more she strives her bulk to fill 3
“ N ay, though you burst, you ne'er shall be so great.’'
No idle image, Horace, of thy state.

Your verses t003 that oil, which feeds the flamm
If ever bard was wise. be thine the name.

That horrid tage of temper—

Horace.
Yet have done. !
Damasippus.
That vast expense—-
Horace.
Good Stoic, mind your own
Damasippus.
'Phose thousand surious passions for the sair-—
Horace.
Thou mightier sool, inferior idiots spa're.
