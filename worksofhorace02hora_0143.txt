. EPISTLES, 3061< 1. 135

'l'liere o' er a book, not too severely, bend,
Resolv‘d to visit his illustrious friend,
When western winds and the first swallow's bring
The welcome tidings of returning spring.

In other taste to me your bounty ssow'd‚
Thau to his guest the rough Calabrian show’d-
‘⁶ These pears are excellent, then, prithee, secd.”--
I've eaten quite enough—‘⁸ Well. You indeed
Shall take some home—as many as you please,
For children love such little gifts as these.‘'
1 thank you, sir, as is they all were mine.—
·* Well, if you leave, you leave them for the swine.''
when sools and spendthrifts give what they despisc,
Thin crops os gratitudo will always rise.
The wise and good with better choiee bestow‚
And real gold from play-house counters know,
But thus much merit let me boldly claim,
No base ingratitude shall stain my uame3
And yet, if 1 must never leave you more,
G ive me my former vig-our, and restore
The hair, that on the youthsul forehead plays ς
Give me to prate with j0y, to laugh with ease,
And o'er the flowing bowl, in sighing suain,
To talk of wauton Cynara's disdain.

Into a wicker cask where corn was kept,
l‘erchance of meagre corps a field-meuse creptz,
But when she fill'd her paurum, and sleek’d her hide..
How to get out again, in vain she tried.

Α weasel, who behelcl her thus distrest,

ln friendly sort the luckless meuse address'd:

“ Would you escape, you must be lean and thim
'rhen try the eranny where you first got iu.‘’
