SATIRES, BOOK ΙΙ. 65·

This too is vile. Now mark, what blessings flow
From temperate meals: and first, they can bestow
That prime of blessings, health ς for you’ll confess
That various meats the stomaeh must oppress,

[3511 you reflect how light, how well you were, ¹
ζ When plain and simple was your cheerful fare ;
v But roast, and boil'd, when you promiscuous ea&

When fowl and shellvfish in confusion meet,
Sweets‚ turn‘d to cholet, with cold phlegm engag· ,
And civil warin the rack'd stomach wage.
Behold how pale the sated guests arise
From suppers, puzzled with varieties!
The body too, with yesterday⁷s excess
Burthen’d and tir'd, shall the pure soul depress ,
Weigh down this portion of celestia] birth,
This breath of God, and fix it to the earth.
who down to sleep from a short supper lies,
Can to the next day’s business vigorous riso,
Or jovial wander (when the circling year
Brings back some sestal day) to better chem,
Or when his wasted strength he would restore,
When years approach, and age's seeble hour
A softer treatment claim. But if in prime
of youth and health you take before your time
The luxuries of life, where is their aid
When age or sickness shall your strength invade?
Our fathers lov'd (and yet they had a nose)
A tainted boar; but 1 believe they chose
The mouldy fragments with a friend to eat,
Rather than eat it whole themselves, and sweerv
Oh! that the earth, when vigorous and young,
Had borne me this heroic tace among!
Do you the voice of Fame with plcasure hear ζ
