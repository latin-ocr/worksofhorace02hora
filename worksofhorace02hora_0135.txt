EPISTLES, BOOK Ι. ἸΞΤ

What do you dare, who float with active wing
Arouud the thymy fragrance os the spring?
Not yours the genius of a lowly strain,
Nor of uncultur’d or unpotish’d vein,
Vl'hether you plead with eloquence his cause3
Or to your client elea-1 the doubtful 1aws;
And sure to gain, for amatorious lays,
The wreaths of ivy, with unenvied praise.
Could you the passions in their rage, control,
'l'hat da mp the nobler purpose of the. soul:
Could you these scothing discontents allay,
soon should you rise where wisdom points the way
Wisdom heaven-born, at which wc all should aim,
The little vulgar, and the known to same,
Who mean to live, within our proper sphere,
Dear to ourselves, ancl to our country dear.
Now tell me, whether Plancus holds a part
(For suro he well (leserves it) in your heart?
Or was the reconciliation made in vain,
And like au ill-cur'd wound breaks forth again.
While inexperienc'd youth, and blood inflam’ct,
Drive ye like coursers to the yoke untam'd?
Where’er ye ate, too excellent to prove
’she broken union of fraternal love,
A votive heifer gratcsully l seed,
For your rcturn, in sacrifice to bleed.
