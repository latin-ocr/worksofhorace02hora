EPISTLES, BOOK 1. 1213

While hoary Nestor, by experience wise,

To reconcile the angry monarchs tries.

His injur’d love the son of releus fires,

And equal passion, equal rage inspires

The breasts of both. When doting monarchs urge
Unsound resolves, their subjects feel the scourge.
Trojans and Greeks, seditious, base, unjust,

Β Offend alike in violence and lust.

To show what wisdom and what sense can do,
The poet sets Ulysses in our view,
who conquer'd Troy, and with sagacious ken
Saw various towns and polities Ofmen ε
While sor himself, and sor his native train‚
Ho seeks a passage through the boundless main,
In perils plung'd‚ the patient hero braves
His adverse sate, and buoys above 'the waves.
You know the Siren's songs, and Circe's draught,
Which had he, senseless and intemperate, quaff'd,
With his companions. he like them, had been
The bruta] vassal osan harlot qeeen3
Had liv'd a dog, bebas’d to vile desire,
Or loathsome swine, and grovel'd in the mire,
But we, mere numbers in the book of life,
Like those who boldly woo'd our hero’s wife,
Boi-n to consume the fruits of earth 3 in truth,
As vain and idle as Phaeacia’s youth3
Mete outside all, to fill the mighty void
Os lise, in dress and equipage employ'd,
Who sleep till mid-day, and with melting aits
of empty music sooth away our cares.
Rogues nightly rise to murder men for peis,
will you not rouse you to preserve yourself?
