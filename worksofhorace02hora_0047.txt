SATIRE VII.

HOW mongrel Persius, in his wrathsul meod.
That outiaw’d wioton, Rupilius King, pursu'd
With poisonous futh, and veuom all his own, ,
To bai-bers and to blear-eyed solk is known.
Persius had wealth by foreign traffic gffln’d,
And a vexatious suit with King maintain'd.
Presumptuoua vain. and obstinate the wight,
Conquering even King in virulence of spite;

In bitterness of speech outstripp’d the wind,
And left the swift-tongued Barrus far behind.

Now to the King returns our wandering tale,
When all fair means of reconcilement fail
(For men are obstinate when war's proclaim'd.
As they with inward courage are inflam'd3
When Hector and Achilles fierce engag'd,
Dite was the conflict‚ and to death they rag'd :
And why? because the gallant thirst of fame,
The love ofgiory, was in* both extreme.

But if a quarrel between cowards rise,

Or between chiefs of le·2s heroic size‚

Glaucus to Diomed is forc'd to yield,

The dastard buys his peace. and quits the field.)
What time o'er Asia with praetorial sway

Great Brutus rul’d, began this dire affray.
Persius and King, intrepid pair, engage

(More equal champions never mounted stage‚)
And now they rush impetuous into court,

Fine was the sight, and delicate the sport.
