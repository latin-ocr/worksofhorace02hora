&94 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Nor sear the censure of my thankless heir,
T'nat Ι have left too little to hisshare 3
And yet the wide distinction would I scau
Between an open, hospitable man,
Λ nd prodigal ; the frugalist secure,
And miser pinch'd with penury3 for sure
It differs, whether you profusely spend
Your wealth, or never entertain a friend 2
Or, wanting prudence, like a play-day bo}
Blindly rusb on, to catch the flying joy.
Aver'c, ye gods, avert the loathsome load
Of want inglorious, and a vile abode.
To me are equa1‚ so they bear their chargf ,ψ
The little pinnaoe, and the losty barge.
Nor am Ι wasted by the swelliug galee
Of winds propitious, with expanded sane,
Nor yet expos'd to tempest-bearing strife‘
Adrift to struggle through the waves of lifes
Last of the first, first of the last in weight,
Parte, vigour‚ person, virtue, birth, estate.
You are noteovetous: be satisfied.

> But are you tainted with no vice beside ?

From vain ambition‚ dread of death's decret,
And feu resentmenss is thy bosom free ?

Say, can you laugh indignant at the scheme&
of magio terrors, visionary dreams,
Portentous wonders, witching imps os hell⁷

’ The nightly goblin, and enchanting spell?

Can you recount with gratitude and mirth
The day revolv'd‚ that gave thy being birth Ψ·
Indulge the failings of thy friends, and grow
More mild and vinnons, as thy seasons flow ³
