180 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

When conquer’d Greece brought! in her captive “
ans,

She triurnph'd o'er her savage conqueror's hearts ς
Taught our rough verse its numbers to refine,
And our rude style with elegance to shine.
And yet some traces of this rustic vein
For a long age remain’d‚ and still remain.
For it was late before our bards inquir'd ’
How the dramatis> Muse her Greeks inspir'd ς
How AEschylus and Thespis form‘d the stage,
And what improv'd the Sophoclean page.
Then to their favourite pieces we applied,
Proud to translate, nor unsuccessful tried ς
-For, ardent and sublime our native vein, v,
It breathes the spirit of the tragic scene, Ὗ
And dares smeessfuk but the Roman Must-
Disdains, or sears, the painful file to use.

Because the cornic poet forms his plays
On common life, they seem a work of ease :
But, if he less indulgence must expect,
Sure he should labour to be more correct.
Even Plautus ill sustains a lover's part,
A frugal sire‘s‚ or wily pander's art.
Dossennus slip·shod shambles o'er the scene,

 

Buffoons, with hungry jests‚ his constant train :
For gold was all their aim, and then the play
Might stand or fall—indifferent were they.

He, who on Glory’s airy chariot tries
To mount the stage, sull osten lives and dies.
A cold spectator chills the hard to death,
But one warm look recalls his fleeting breath.
Such light, such trivial things (lepress or raise
A soul that feels this avarIce of praise.
