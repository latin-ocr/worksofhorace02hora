126 THE WORKS OF HORACE3

EPISTLE III.

ΤΟ JULIUS FLORUS·

FLORUS, I long to know where Claudius leadsv

The distant rage of war 3 whether he spreads
His conquering banners o’er the Thracian plains,
Or near the Heber‚ bound in snowy chains.

Or does the Hellespont’s high-tower’d sea,
Or Asia's fertile. soil, his course delay?
What works of genius do the youth prepare,
who guard his sacred person ? Who shall dare
To sing great Caesar’s wars, immortal theme!
And give his peaceful honours down to fame?
How faresmy Titius? Say, when he intends
To publish? Does he not forget his friends?
He, who disdm'ns the springs of common fame,
And dauntless quaffs the deep Pindaric stream..
But will the Muse her savourite bard inspire, ς
To tune to Theban sounds the Roman lyre?

Or with the transports os theatric rage,

And its sonorous language‚ shake the stage?

Let Celsus be admonish'd, o'er and o‘er,

To search the treasures of his native sture,

Nor touch what Phoebus consecrates to Fame3
¹hest, when the birds their various plumage’ alaim,-
Stripp'd of his stolen pride, the crow son-lom
:zhould stand the laughter os the public stom:
