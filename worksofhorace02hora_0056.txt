48 '² THE WORKS OF HORACE.

Salute, escort him through the street.
'rhere’s nothing gotten in this life,
Without a world ostoil andstrife !”
While thus he racks my tortur’d ears, '
A much lov'd friend of mine appears,
Aristius Fuscus, one who knew
My sweet companion through and through.
We stop, exchanging ‘⁶ so and so :”
‘⁴ Whence come, and whither do you go ἓ’”
1 then began in woful wise
To nod my head, distort my eyes,
And pull his renegado sleeve,
That he would grant me a reprieve ς
But he was absent all the while,
Malieious with a leering smile.
Provok‘d at his dissimulation,
1 burst with spleen and indignation. n
“ I know not what you had to tell
[n private.'‘—I remetnber well:
But shall a day of business choose‚
This i‘s the Sabbath of the J θῖνες
You would not thus offend the leathern-
Curtail’d assemblies of the brethren”——-
‘ I have no scruples‚ by your leave,
On that account.'—“ But, sir, Ι have ε
1 am a little superstitious,
Like many of the crowd capricious:
Forgive me, if it be a crime,
And Ι shall talk another time.”--
Oh 2 that so black a sun should rise!
Away the cruel creature ffies,
And leaves me panting for my lise
Aghast beneath the butcher’s knise.
