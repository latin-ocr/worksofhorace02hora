EPIS'TLE xvu,
To SCAEVA.

ALTHOUGH my ‘Scaeva knows with art corn-
* plote,

How to· converse familiar with the great,

Yet to th’ instruction of an humble friend,

Who would himself be better taught, atton&

Tho' blind your guido, some precepts yet unknown

He may disclose‚ which you may make yout own⁴
Are you with tranquil, easy pleasure blest,

Or atter sun-rise love an hour ofirest,

Is dusty streets, the rattling ohariot's noiso,

Or if the neighbouring tavern’s midnight joys.

Dolight you not, by my advice retreat

To the calm rapturos of a rural sofltz ᾗ(

For pleasure's not confln'd to wealth alone, ’
