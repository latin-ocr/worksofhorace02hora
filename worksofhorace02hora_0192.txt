‘584 THE WORKS 01²* HORACR

The hero's face, than in the poet’s lines
His lise and manners; nor would Horace choose
These low and grovelling numbers, could his Mus<-
The rapid progress of your arms pursue3
Paint distant lands and rivers to the view,
Up the steep mountain with thy war ascend,
Storm the proud fort, and bid the nations bend ς
Or bid fell war‘s destructive horrors cease,
And shut up J anus in eternal peace,
While Parthia bows beneath the Roman name.
And yields her glories to our prince's fame.

But Caesar’s majesty would sure refuse

The feeble praises of my lowly muse, g

Nor 1, with conscious modesty, should darc
Attempt a subject Ι want strength to bear ς
For sure a soolish fondness of the heart,
At least in rhiming and the Muse's art,
Hurts whom it loves ς for quickly we discern,
With ease remember, and with pleasure learn.
'Whate'er may ridicule and laughter move,
Not what deserves our best esteem and love.
ΑΙΙ such provoking fondness 1 disclaim,
Nor wish to stand expos’d to public shame
In wax-work sorm’d, with horrible grimace‚
Nor in splay-footed rhimes to show my sace:
Blushing the fulsome present to receive.
And with my author be condemn‘d to live ς
Perhaps, in the same open’d basket laid,
Down to the street together be convey‘d,
Where pepper, odom-s, frankincense are sold,
And all small wases in wretched rhimes enroll'd
