32 THE WORKS OF HORACE.

May by right rule and reason play the fool.
When from the roos the dar-ted pippins bound,
Does the glad omen prove your senses sound ?

Or when with aged tongue you lisp your phrases-·- - Δ

Is he more mad, who that child-cottage raises?
Then add the murders of this fond desire,
And with the sword provoke the madding fire.
When jealous Marius late his mistress slew,
And from a precipice himself he threw‚
VVas he not mad? or can you by your rule
Condemn the mu'rderer, and acquit the fool?
But though in civil phrase you change the name,
Hadman and fool for ever arethe same.
With hands clean wash'd, a sober, ancient wight
Ran praying through the streets at early light,
‘⁶ Snatch me from death ; grant me alone to live:
No mighty boon3 with ease the gods can give.”
Sound were his senses; yet. if he were sold,
His master sure this weakness must have told,
And, if not fond a law-suit to mammio,
Must have consess'd the slave unsound of brain.
This crowd is by the doctrine of our schools
Enroll’d in the large family of fools.
Her child beneath a quartan sever lies
For full five months ; when the fond-‚mother eries,
‘⁶ Sickness and health are thine, all-powersul Jove,-
Then from my son this dire disease remove3
And when your priests thy solemn sasst prmlaim,
Naked the boy shall stand in Tiber's stream.”
Should chance, or the physician's art, up·raise
Her infant from this desperate disease‚
The frantie dame shall plunge her hapless boy,
Bring back the sever, and the child destroy.
